	abstract = {The broadscale grid integration of renewable energy posts threat on the adequacy of regulation capability of power systems. Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is thus receiving increasing attention due to its ability to provide trustworthy adjustment capability. When conducting load tracking tasks, the Static Voltage Characteristics (SVCs) are usually ignored, which could lead to abnormal operation of distributed energy resources sensitive to voltage variations. In this paper, A load tracking method considering SVC is proposed, where the SVC of PV inverter, energy storage device and Inverter Air Conditioner (IAC) are considered by equality constraints in load tracking models. This method is able to ensure the conduction of load tracking in VPP without affecting the normal operation of loads. An experiment is setup based on an improved IEEE 13-bus power system to analyze the effects of whether to consider SVC and regulation capability of IAC on load tracking performances. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research analyses the case of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in regulated electricity markets, trading energy with the consumers and the grid under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The VPP propagates the deployment of solar PVs while balancing its intermittency with a dispatchable power plant, which is assumed in this research to be a CCHP, supplying cooling, heating, and power. The VPP also integrates energy storage systems for a comprehensive assessment. Traditionally, the VPP concept has not been introduced in regulated markets, but it is widely researched in deregulated markets where VPPs trade energy with the electricity grid for profit maximisation. In regulated markets, a special architecture is proposed for a VPP that mediates between residential compounds and electricity grids for profit maximization and energy demand coverage, thus converting the compound into a power generator with minimum dependence on the grid for its energy demand. In the literature on aggregated energy systems in regulated markets, it is usually overlooked to perform detailed energy modelling and optimisation on an hourly level. Only basic rule-based frameworks for energy management are proposed. In this research, it is initially assumed that since the VPP integrates multi-energy components supplying heating, cooling and electricity, optimization of the output of each component for a common profit maximization, is necessary. However, in VPP-related literature, the capacity of each component, which is a main input for energy modelling, is traditionally assumed and not assessed. Therefore, the research aims to explore how to find the optimal capacity configuration of the residential VPP that achieves optimal profit. The paper analyses an iterative exhaustive search framework, integrating the 2-levels of energy optimisation (hourly profit maximisation objective) and capacities optimisation (Life cycle CAPEX & OPEX minimisation). Compared to baseline cases, where only energy optimisation is performed, and capacities are assumed and not assessed in terms of capital investment, the proposed framework achieved a higher annual profit by 3.1 % and a payback period of 11 years. The results also provide comprehensive 3D charts drawing the relations between the achieved profit against capacities configurations, thus allowing high-level decision-making. The results also prove the hypothesis that hourly energy optimisation should not be performed without investment cost assessment and that targeting the minimization of investment costs will indirectly benefit the achieved profit. © 2024},

	abstract = {A virtual power plant (VPP) is typically a collection of distributed energy resources (DERs) aggregated by an energy service provider (ESP). However, recruiting DER owners to participate in a VPP is challenging. Therefore, we propose a profitable and flexible VPP recruitment-participation approach that incorporates both long-term regular recruitment and short-term casual recruitment. Casual recruitment caters to ambitious DER participants, consisting of fair and bet-on modes. The latter establishes a set of pre-determined payoff conditions, the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of which confers the participants a contractual right to get compensation from the ESP. To ensure the success of the proposed recruitment approach, we address two key problems. First, we introduce a new index, unconventional arbitrage opportunity (UAO), for evaluating future profits and propose a conditional time series generative adversarial network to predict UAO with weather conditions. Second, we introduce a payoff allocation method that combines fairness and incentives to motivate casual DER participants. The incentive coefficients are optimized using an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the proposed recruitment-participation approach, the effectiveness of the UAO prediction model, and the optimized incentive coefficients. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the development of the energy and carbon markets, it has become a trend for multiple virtual power plants (MVPP) that aggregate distributed resources from different regions to participate in market trading through cooperative operation. In order to study the energy-carbon interactions between VPPs and the supply-demand interactions for MVPP and users, this paper introduces a load aggregator (LA) and establishes a cooperative alliance consisting of MVPP and LA. Firstly, a carbon emission allowance allocation and transaction mechanism for MVPP is proposed based on the modified Shapley value method, which considers the impact of energy interactions within the alliance on the carbon emissions. Then, a cooperation model for the MVPP-LA alliance is established based on Nash bargaining theory, and it is decomposed into two subproblems of the maximal alliance benefits and the optimal benefit distribution. In terms of benefit distribution, this paper modifies the bargaining mechanism based on the contribution of each VPP to the alliance benefit. A dynamic penalty factor-based alternating direction method of multipliers (DP-ADMM) is used to solve the two subproblems in a distributed manner. Finally, the validity of the proposed trading mechanism, allocation method and solution algorithm are verified through several cases. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

By judiciously aggregating geographically distributed energy resources (DERs) as individual electrical entities, VPPs can provide capacity and ancillary services to grid operations and participate in electricity wholesale markets. This paper aims to provide a concise overview of the concept and development of VPPs and the latest progresses in VPP operation, with the focus on VPP scheduling and control.

	abstract = {Aiming at a large number of decentralized resources such as rural biomass, rooftop photovoltaic, and decentralized wind power, a novel rural virtual power plant (VPP) has been conceptualized. The VPP is integrated by biomass waste conversion system (BWC), carbon to energy (C2P), demand response aggregator (DRA), and distributed renewable energy (DRE), namely, BDCD-VPP. Then, this paper proposes a data-driven two-stage robust optimization dispatching model for BDCD-VPP considering carbon-green certificates equivalent conversion mechanism. This model aims to address the uncertainty of wind power plants (WPP) and photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Strong duality theorem (SDT) and C&CG algorithm are applied to construct this model. Thirdly, the Aumann-Shapley method (A-S) was enhanced by incorporating risk factor, cost factor, and carbon reduction factor. This refinement results in the development of a synergistic scheduling revenue allocation method for electricity‑carbon-green certificates. Finally, the Lankao rural energy revolution pilot program in China is selected as the case study, the results showed: (1) The BDCD-VPP aggregates distributed energy sources such as the rural WPP and the PV to realize electricity‑carbon-electricity cycle effect. The BDCD-VPP generates a green certificate revenue of 47.17¥/MWh and exhibited carbon emissions of 0.37 t/MWh. The proposed Carbon-Green Certificates Equivalent Conversion Mechanism increases BDCD-VPP benefit ratio by 3.52%. (2) The proposed two-stage robust optimization dispatching model enhances the ability of BDCD-VPP to adapt to uncertainty. Compared to the day-ahead stage, biomass power generation (BPG) and waste power generation (WPG) increase upward peaking power by 24.05% and 9.99% in intra-day stage. Flue gas treatment system (FG-TS), gas-power plant carbon capture (GPPCC) and power to gas (P2G) increase downward peaking power by 65.15%, 70.99% and 25.94%. (3) Utilizing the proposed benefit allocation methodology, BPG and WPG need to concede 38.25¥/MWh and 65.02¥/MWh for carbon emissions associated with electricity. WPP and PV need to concede 64.25¥/MWh and 33.71¥/MWh for power generation uncertainty. GPPCC, P2G, DRA, and small hydropower station (SHS) obtain revenues of 24.48 ¥/MWh, 55.07 ¥/MWh, 70.38 ¥/MWh, and 51.30 ¥/MWh. Compared to the A-S, the proposed benefit allocation methodology exhibits 6.92% improvement in satisfaction. Overall, the proposed data-driven two-stage robust optimization dispatching model and benefit allocation strategy facilitates the optimal aggregation and utilization of rural distributed energy resources, considering the interests of various stakeholders. This is conducive to achieving a clean and low-carbon transformation of the overall energy structure. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

VPP aggregates massive demand-side resources to provide power systems with the FFCAS. It faces excessive communication and computation tasks. Edge computing addresses these issues through computation offloading. Heavy tasks can be partially offloaded to the edge to relieve the burden of the central server. Existing offloading methods, however, are not specific for the VPP. To fill the gap, first, an age of information (AoI) model is introduced to characterize the data flow of an edge-enabled VPP. Next, an AoI-based FFCAS performance evaluation model is proposed considering the impacts of communication delay, communication failures, and computational delay. Then an FFCAS performance optimization model is formulated. It aims to maximize VPP's profit through communication offloading and the DSR portfolio determination. Simulation results show that the proposed method can efficiently improve VPP's profit. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With deepening decarbonization and increased Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) integration, the power system's inertia has declined, affecting the network's ability to balance power at the distribution level. Concurrently, the proliferation of prosumers presents a regulatory opportunity for Distribution System Operators (DSOs), despite the complexity introduced by their high number and varied behaviors. This paper introduces a new co-scheduling model optimizing prosumers' capacities through Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) in local networks, enhancing DSO oversight and facilitating prosumer participation in regulation markets. The proposed model concurrently schedules energy provision alongside voltage and frequency regulation capacities. Recognizing prosumers' behavioral uncertainties, Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Optimization (DDRO) is employed to ensure adequate capacity for VPP engagement. Importantly, the paper outlines a mechanism allowing DSOs to partner with multiple privately-owned VPPs, ensuring privacy through an adaptive Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method. This method avoids the exchange of sensitive information, ensuring confidentiality and scalability. Consequently, VPPs can proficiently manage scheduling and communicate their regulation capacities. The operator then dispatches control signals based on regulation needs and network flow. Results from the IEEE 33 bus test system confirm the model's efficacy in enhancing voltage support and frequency regulation, and generating revenue for both VPPs and prosumers. © 2023},

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-stage distributionally robust approach for offering and pricing strategy of a virtual power plant (VPP) acting as a price-maker in the day-ahead market. The model incorporates uncertainties related to distributed photovoltaic (PV) output, real-time market price and charging stations demand. In the first stage, the VPP determines its day-ahead market bids/offers as a price maker and releases the retail price to the charging stations based on the worst case of probability distribution realizations. In the second stage, the VPP optimizes energy storage operations and the power transactions in the real-time market to maximize its revenue according to the optimal first stage decisions. To efficiently solve the two-stage model, a customized column-and-constraint generation algorithm (C&CG) is designed that decomposes non-convex subproblems into several small-scale linear programming problems that are independent of each other. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through case studies conducted with the IEEE 33-bus system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Virtual power plant (VPP) emerges as a promising integration and aggregation technology that facilitates the utilization of massive flexible demand-side resources (DSRs). However, non-negligible modeling errors and high-dimensional uncertainties involved in DSR aggregation threaten the delivery reliability and cost-effectiveness of VPP operation. To address this problem, this study proposes an integrated three-stage scheduling framework for VPPs and develops a model-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. In the proposed framework, the VPP scheduling problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), which depicts the complex interaction process among the three stages (bidding, re-dispatching and disaggregation). The interactions are evaluated by a comprehensive reward function, incorporating the trading and operation costs, as well as imbalance penalties. To enable decentralized decision-making, a model-assisted multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA2PPO) algorithm is proposed, which trains a separate actor network for each aggregator. Additionally, the MA2PPO is augmented with a model-assisted safety decision-making method to accelerate the training process. Numerical simulation results verify that the proposed method enhances the delivery reliability and cost-effectiveness of the VPP, while achieving faster convergence time compared with purely model-free MARL methods. © 2024},

The traditional model transformation method has low computational efficiency and poor ability to deal with strong uncertainty. The optimality and convergence of the solution are not fully guaranteed. Therefore, this paper intends to use a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to reach a fast solution to the market equilibrium model. Here we take the interaction between multiple virtual power plants (VPPs) and the upstream power grid as an example. A bi-level mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is constructed. The upper level aims to minimize the cost of running the VPPs, the lower level aims to minimize the cost of running the power grid. A multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to solve the MPEC based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), which is a data-driven, selflearning and model-free approach without the modeling and computational complexity caused by existing methods. Finally, an example of iteration between an IEEE-30 node power grid system and a VPP is given to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The model represents a first-of-its-kind in planning a multi-layer supply chain network in which renewable-based electric-thermal cogeneration is coordinated in production-climate nexus. The study yields the following findings. First, products with larger energy use opt to be made in locations with stronger sunshine or wind profile despite higher transportation costs. Second, the time-of-use rate greatly stimulates the installation of onsite photovoltaics and energy storage.

	abstract = {Multi-building multi-energy virtual power plants (MB-ME-VPPs) show great promise for the aggregation and coordination of distributed flexible resources across multiple integrated energy buildings to participate in electricity markets. However, a significant challenge arises when managing the energy of MB-ME-VPPs, especially since buildings can dynamically join or depart during the aggregation phase. Traditional model-based optimization methods face difficulties in obtaining accurate mathematical models of individual buildings, and may also raise privacy concerns. In contrast, model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods offer a promising alternative by allowing agents to learn their control policies through interactions with their environments. Nevertheless, conventional MARL methods are normally applied in static multi-agent environments, where the number and identity of agents remain fixed and predetermined. Consequently, these conventional MARL methods lack the ability to adapt to the dynamic behaviors of agents joining or leaving the environment. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach named MAT-Adapt, embedding the multi-agent transformer with a parallel adapter module, to address the dynamic participation issue in MB-ME-VPP energy management. Firstly, it formulates the coordination of building agents as a sequential modeling process and leverages the representational capabilities of the attention mechanism from the multi-agent transformer technique. Secondly, it introduces a parallel adapter module called AdaptMLP to enhance adaptability during the dynamic participation phase, efficiently reducing the need for extensive fine-tuning of model parameters. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distributional electricity market with 3 to 9 multi-energy buildings show the superior performance of our proposed MAT-Adapt method in facilitating efficient coordination of dynamically participating buildings within the context of the MB-ME-VPP. In comparison to the conventional MADDPG and MAPPO methods training from scratch, the proposed MAT-Adapt method demonstrates its superior adaptability, achieving 0.75–0.91 normalized rewards in new state conditions within 5% of training episodes, while MADDPG and MAPPO can only reach 0.11–0.43 within the same timeframe. Furthermore, the proposed MAT-Adapt method exhibits its strong generalization performance by evaluating the dynamic participation of various building types and regions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) are susceptible to cyber anomalies due to their extensive communication layer. FL-trust, an improved federated learning (FL) approach, has been recently introduced as a mitigation system for cyber-attacks. However, current FL-trust enhancements, relying solely on proportional-integral (PI), exhibit drawbacks like sensitivity to controller gain fluctuations and a slow response to sudden disturbances, and conventional FL-trust is not directly applicable to the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets common in VPPs. To address these limitations, we introduce an artificial neural network (ANN)-based technique to adapt FL-trust to non-IID datasets. The ANN is designed as an intelligent anomaly mitigation control method, employing a dynamic recurrent neural network with exogenous inputs. We consider the effects of the most common VPP attacks, poisoning attacks, on the distributed cooperative controller at the secondary control level. The ANN is trained offline and tested online in the simulated VPP. Using MATLAB simulations on a HOMER-modeled VPP, the proposed technique demonstrates its superior ability to sustain normal VPP operation amidst cyber anomalies, outperforming a PI-based mitigation system in accuracy and detection speed. © 2024 by the authors.},

The TVPP determines optimal energy, reserve and flexibility bids to maximize its profit in wholesale market by specifying the DERs' optimal schedules. Energy and reserve products are scheduled in hourly time intervals while flexibility products are scheduled in sub-hourly time intervals to meet the net loads' sub-hourly variability and uncertainty. The DERs dispersed in the network contain conventional distributed generators, energy storage systems, responsive loads and photovoltaic units and the TVPP considers the DERs' constraints as well as the distribution network operational limits in its decision-making process. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Implemented on a standard test system, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) offer system flexibility by aggregating various distributed energy resources (DERs) and simultaneously create profit opportunities for these DERs. A fair and scientific operational model serves as a crucial guarantee for promoting the economically efficient operation of VPPs. Given that DERs are typically managed by various agents, this study introduces a multi‑leader single-follower Nash-Stackelberg game model. This model is designed to facilitate the optimal aggregation of DER agents in a competitive distribution-level market involving multiple players. In the optimization modeling, the DER agents function as leaders, formulating their bidding strategies to maximize profits. Conversely, the VPP acts as a follower, responsible for performing market clearing. The distributed locational marginal price derived from this process serves as the settlement basis for DERs. Furthermore, a level-k reasoning approach is used to simulate the strategic bidding behavior of agents. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation model in simulating the competitive dynamics among agents. This model offers an expanded set of Nash equilibrium solutions for VPPs, enabling the selection of suitable aggregation schemes tailored to practical requirements. Additionally, the proposed bounded rationality model mitigats the strategic bidding behavior of agents, which consequently leads to a reduction in the system cost. © 2023},

	abstract = {The accelerating trend towards electrification in seaport operations presents the opportunities for ports to achieve near zero and decarbonization strategies. However, integrating a large number of flexible resources into seaport energy systems introduces complex management challenges, including the need for coordinated charging of electrified vessels and the optimized energy utilization of seaport equipment. To address these challenges, we establish a seaport virtual power plant (SVPP) system model and an energy service model that leverages the concepts of vessel-to-shore (V2S) and vessel-to-vessel (V2V) for facilitating diverse energy transfer modes among the grid, shore, and vessels. To unlock the flexible value of electrified vessels, we propose an energy sharing scheduling method that integrates a hybrid V2S and V2V mode. This method considers the diversity in vessel berthing durations and charging demands, utilizing V2V interaction mechanisms among electrified vessels to determine the optimal shore-vessel scheduling schemes. To ensure the privacy and reliability of multi-entity operations, we design a decentralized energy management algorithm for the SVPP based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A decentralized optimization framework is designed based on the consensus mechanism. By introducing coupling information as consensus variables, we fully decouple the operations of multiple owners and solve the primal optimization problem in parallel. Additionally, by formulating two baseline optimization problems, we evaluate the effects of V2S and V2V on the overall SVPP and on the individual vessels. Simulation results demonstrate that introducing V2S can reduce the total cost by 13.68%, while the further integration of V2V can achieve a cost reduction of 26.56%. Notably, V2V interactions enhance the scheduling potential, particularly for vessels with longer berthing durations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Modern grids are facing a reduction of system inertia and primary frequency regulation capability due to the high penetration of distributed energy resources. In this paper, a decision-making framework is proposed to facilitate community-based virtual power plants (cVPPs) to promptly provide ancillary services to the grid. A non-convex cVPP decision-making model is established to optimize the operational plans of a cVPP's internal energy resources and the bids it puts in a local energy market to minimize the cVPP's operation cost. Bidding and management strategies will be automatically executed by solving each participating cVPP's decision-making problem. Due to its nature of high complexity and intractability, the problem is transformed into a partially observable Markov game model and solved by a multi-agent actor transformer-based critic method. A shared transformer encoder is used in the critic network to extract more robust features from the cVPPs’ observations and actions. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively support cVPPs to autonomously generate energy bidding and management strategies without acquiring other cVPPs’ private information. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {As the energy market evolves into a dynamic and interactive landscape, the distributed nature of virtual power plant (VPP) becomes increasingly significant. This shift highlights the limitations of traditional centralized optimization approaches in capturing the complex interplay among various stakeholders. In response, this article introduces a novel multi-entity distributed collaborative optimization strategy for an integrated energy system (IES) that incorporates a VPP, electric vehicles, and carbon capture technologies, under the Stackelberg master-slave game framework. Within this framework, the VPP operator (VPPO) assumes the role of the leader, while the energy supply aggregator (ESA), customer side residential load aggregator (CSRLA), electric vehicles aggregator (EVA), and carbon treatment system aggregator (CTSA) are positioned as the followers. The paper delves into the development of interaction strategies for each entity, aiming at achieving optimal objectives. The study undergoes by presenting the mathematical model of the VPP-integrated energy system, which is seamlessly integrated into the master-slave game structure. This integration facilitates the creation of a distributed multi-entity cooperative optimization model featuring a single leader and multiple followers, with the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium being rigorously established. Therefore, the research employs a hybrid nutcracker optimization algorithm and quadratic programming (NOA-QP) method to address the engineering challenge of optimizing operator energy pricing. The case study conducted demonstrates that the proposed scheduling methodology improves the VPP system profit by 10.80%, increases the aggregation profit by up to 1317.22%, optimizes the carbon emissions by 15.59%, and significantly improves the solution efficiency of the VPP by 99.29%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is a promising solution to power systems' challenges. However, its energy management system (EMS) faces challenges due to centralized Big-Data analysis, i.e., complexity and high computational cost. Decentralized strategies, e.g., federated learning (FL), have been proposed to mitigate these challenges. Although conventional FL can be implemented in VPPs, its effectiveness is limited by its typical structure, which relies on single-pattern modeling. Indeed, this particular structure leads to delays and inaccuracies in optimizing the heterogeneous generator dispatch patterns, particularly renewables. Hence, addressing this critical hindrance is essential for FL's efficient and effective deployment in VPPs. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes novel VPP modeling utilizing multi-task FL modernized by multi-pattern modeling to decentralize the EMS processing. The proposed FL defines electricity generators' agents as clients collaborating to train the decentralized local data coordinated by a central server. The innovative idea is to create a novel multi-pattern-multi-task FL for electricity generation prediction so that the generator's agents learn to provide an optimized dispatch. Thus, the conventional multi-task FL is improved by proposing an optimized neural-network clustering technique. Simulation results demonstrate that multi-pattern-multi-task FL is 39%-41% faster than the best-reported methods, i.e., teaching–learning-based and honey-bee-mating optimization algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy in power grids introduces higher levels of uncertainty, while current decision-making models typically favour either a risk-averse or risk-neural strategy, and the research works related to windfall profit-aware risk-seeking strategies are quite limited. In this paper, a novel concept of integrated risk-seeking/averse preference is proposed, and a windfall profit-aware stochastic scheduling model for an industrial virtual power plant (IVPP) is developed based on this type of risk preference, which can realize the joint management of potential high profits and extreme losses. Firstly, the potential best- and worst-case results are incorporated into the holistic decision-making framework, which are quantified by the value at best (VaB) and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) measures, respectively. Next, the windfall profit-aware stochastic scheduling model is developed for the optimal operation of IVPP in day-ahead and real-time electricity markets, where multi-type flexible resources, such as energy conversion and storage devices, industrial production workstations, material storages and financial instruments, are utilized to improve expected profits and minimize the potential risks. Specifically, two types of credit-based virtual transactions, increment and decrement bids, are employed by the IVPP to increase its trading flexibility in electricity markets. Finally, simulation studies are conducted for a multi-energy IVPP to validate the proposed windfall profit-aware framework and model, showcasing that the risk-seeking and risk-averse preferences of decision-makers can be fully satisfied simultaneously under actual market environment. Moreover, risk parameters can be adjusted accordingly to manage windfall profits, expected profits, and extreme losses flexibly in electricity markets. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) possess the capability to aggregate flexible resources to provide grid services in the distributed network operation. The potential for flexibility utilization in building loads, particularly thermal-controlled ones, has drawn attention when aggregated into VPPs. This work proposes a data-driven approach to overcome the challenges in modeling and aggregation of thermal dynamics within clustered buildings. Specifically, we utilize piecewise linear equations to represent the impact of various input features on thermal dynamics (i.e., zone temperature variation), which is more precise in extracting the nonlinear relationship through adaptive model order adjustment and breakpoint determination. Additionally, we transform the identified thermal dynamic process into virtual storage models and aggregate them into the optimization-based system dispatch process. The proposed two-stage aggregation approach facilitates the determination of accurate dispatch decisions by iteratively updating the power bounds of flexibility regions. It ensures disaggregation feasibility simultaneously to generate individual power signals for each building. Case simulations verify the accuracy of the proposed method on modeling and aggregation of thermal dynamics within clustered buildings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

To improve the transient performance (settling time, overshoot, etc.) of the frequency response under load disturbances, we introduce a novel Droop Reset Integral Control (DRIC) law that synergistically combines resetting integrators with integral droop controllers (also referred to as proportional integral (PI) control in the literature). We prove the stability of the proposed control scheme, and its robustness to external disturbances, using conditions based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) that can be numerically verified a priori. Furthermore, we validate the proposed approach using both learned voltage source inverter dynamics and a high-fidelity Simscape model developed by Sandia National Laboratories. Our results show that the DRIC algorithm is able to significantly reduce overshoot, induce zero steady-state error, and decrease settling times up to 7 times that of standard droop and PI control. We also provide heuristic tuning guidelines for the proposed controller, which can be particularly useful for system operators whenever a detailed model of the virtual power plant is unavailable. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the high proportion of renewable energy integration continuously boosts the grid's demand for regulation capacity. But the reasonable utilization remains challenged between the regulation capacity of demand-side resources and the complementary characteristics between market players. This paper primarily investigates the issues of complementary synergy among different types of resources and different microgrids. This is currently a focal point in enhancing the regulation capacity of the power grid. This study considers a variety of resources to form microgrids with distinct characteristics, including residential and industrial loads as typical demand-side resources, which have distinct power and energy features in the demand-side regulation market. Furthermore, this study considers virtual power plants (VPPs) consisting of multiple microgrids (MMGs) in the energy market and regulation market as a two-stage problem with day-ahead scheduling and real-time energy consumption control. Based on this, we develop optimal scheduling models and an adaptive MG participation mechanism to maximize the economic benefit of the VPP and help ensure the frequency stability of the power grid. Innovatively, this work designs an adaptive MG participation mechanism, when the operational cost of the adaptive microgrid is high and the regulation capacity of other microgrids is sufficient to provide frequency support for the grid, the adaptive microgrid will be set as backup.

However, the inherent uncertainty of load and renewable generation poses a challenge to reliable VPP power scheduling. This manuscript proposes a novel method for day-ahead VPP scheduling with a joint probabilistic guarantee on its power availability without violating the DER constraints and network constraints. A surrogate polytope is first used to find the inner approximation of the VPP power, implicitly including the low-level DER power, DER constraints, and network constraints. Then, a multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to fit the random parameters of the surrogate polytope, after which the iterative supporting hyperplane algorithm is used to solve the VPP scheduling problem. Extensive case studies based on real-world renewable generation scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in out-of-sample cost and reliability, with a manageable computing complexity. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Prediction interval (PI) is an effective tool to quantify uncertainty and usually serves as an input to downstream robust optimization. Traditional approaches focus on improving the quality of PI in the view of statistical scores and assume the improvement in quality will lead to a higher value in the power systems operation. However, such an assumption cannot always hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a value-oriented PI forecasting approach, which aims at reducing operational costs in downstream operations. For that, it is required to issue PIs with the guidance of operational costs in robust optimization, which is addressed within the contextual bandit framework here. Concretely, the agent is used to select the optimal quantile proportion, while the environment reveals the costs in operations as rewards to the agent. As such, the agent can learn the policy of quantile proportion selection for minimizing the operational cost. The numerical study regarding the day-ahead and real-time operation of a virtual power plant verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of operational value. And it is especially evident in the context of extensive penetration of wind power. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While South Africa is deemed one of the countries with the highest irradiation levels, it still utilises coal as its primary energy source due to its abundance. Due to the world-wide drive towards carbon neutrality, residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial consumers are considering small-scale embedded generation systems. The National Rationalised Specifications 097-2-3 document specifies the scale of the embedded generation capacity a consumer is allowed to install. However, specifications do not yet make the required provisions for the addition of energy storage. The effective collective management of the grouped small-scale embedded generation systems could provide a high level of energy security and increase the percentage of renewable energy generation in the total energy mix. Potential challenges come into play when considering the stochastic nature of photovoltaic generation and its effect on the storage capacity and the dispersion in load profiles of the residential units typically present on a low-voltage network. This paper contributes by investigating the utilisation of photovoltaic generation in conjunction with storage as the basis for virtual power plant control, with the aim to safely increase renewable energy penetration and improve energy security, all while remaining within the South African low-voltage regulatory limits. A two-level virtual power plant controller is proposed with the dispersed energy storage units as the primary controllable resources and the dispersed photovoltaic generation as the secondary controllable resources. The objective of the controller is to achieve nodal energy management, energy sharing, and ancillary service provision and finally to increase renewable energy penetration. A representative single-feeder low-voltage network is simulated, and test cases of 50% and 75% renewable energy penetration are investigated as the basis for evaluation. The proposed controller architecture proved to maintain network integrity for both test cases. The adaptability of the controller architecture was also confirmed for a changed feeder topology; in this case, it was a multi-feeder topology. Future work is warranted to inform policy on the allowed levels of renewable energy penetration to be based not only on demand but also on the level of energy storage present in a network. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Adapting virtual power plants (VPPs) to the development of new power systems has gradually become a trend. Meanwhile, the economical and effective use of demand-side resources in VPPs has become a research hotspot in the field of new energy. This paper proposes a low-carbon operation strategy with progressive demand response (DR). A DR model id established by evaluating the scheduling potential of low-carbon and flexible loads and the DR transfer of different users motivated by incentive mechanisms. Because the changing carbon price in carbon trading also affects the response transfer amount, it is beneficial to reduce the operating cost of the energy system by using consumers’ surplus value according to consumer psychology to guide energy users to participate in DR. Finally, wind, light, user load data and VPP internal unit output are optimized in rolling mode over multiple time scales, and the optimal adjustment results of the previous day are taken as the basis. At the same time, the output deviation penalty function is added to further reduce the system cost. The nonlinear model of DR cost is transformed into a mixed integer linear model, which is modeled on MATLAB software and solved by a CPLEX optimization solver. The case analysis shows that the progressive DR strategy may increase the total operating cost of the system, but reduce the cost of the carbon emission. The proposed model and method can not only improve the feasibility and effectiveness of market supervision strategy, but also provides a useful reference for operators and demand-side users in energy systems to choose strategies. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper develops a risk-aware net demand forecasting product for virtual power plants, which helps reduce the risk of high operation costs. At the training phase, a bilevel program for parameter estimation is formulated, where the upper level optimizes over the forecast model parameter to minimize the conditional value-at-risk (a risk metric) of operation costs. The lower level solves the operation problems given the forecast. Leveraging the specific structure of the operation problem, we show that the bilevel program is equivalent to a convex program when the forecast model is linear. Numerical results show that our approach effectively reduces the risk of high costs compared to the forecasting approach developed for risk-neutral decision makers. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the rise of distributed energy resources (DERs), virtual power plants (VPPs) have gained intensive academic and industrial attention. While current centralized VPPs benefit from their large aggregated capacity in the wholesale market, they lack effective incentivizing participants for asset investment and market participation. Conversely, the peer-to-peer (P2P) market offers better profits for prosumers through direct trading; however, transactions hinge on approval from associated authorities, such as electricity retailers, who read their power meters. Such an approval procedure becomes complex, even impossible, when more retailers are involved. Hosting the P2P market in a VPP environment can conveniently resolve this issue. This paper proposes a novel holistic P2P (H-P2P) market model hosted in a VPP environment to provide the VPP participants with financial incentives and optimize the network and market operations simultaneously. The proposed new market structure and trade principle allow the proposed H-P2P market to trade active and reactive energies for both financial benefits and network constraints. Using the novel transactive voltage/VAR control (TVVC) method proposed in this paper, the reactive energy trading through the P2P market can support effective voltage regulation and incentivize the VPP participants to provide such voltage control ancillary services actively. Finally, a novel multi-stage P2P negotiation process is introduced to divide the VPP regulatory, active and reactive energy convergence stages, which allows faster P2P decision-making with improved computing efficiency than the conventional multi-period alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The case study validates that the proposed H-P2P market can increase the financial incentives of the prosumers who install PVs and batteries by a large extent and the pure load units by a relatively smaller percentage. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) have been widely recognized as a key enabler for energy system neutrality. The communication traffic of a VPP fundamentally indicates its activeness in interacting with the power system, thus providing a new dimension in depicting the behaviour characteristics of distributed energy resources in VPPs. Therefore, the prediction of communication traffic is significant in improving the control efficiency of VPPs. However, due to the involvement of numerous interactive agents characterised by both individual randomness and coordinative characteristics, traditional prediction models are no longer capable of fitting VPP communication traffic effectively. Therefore, a novel prediction model is introduced that enhances the prediction accuracy by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). This model employs VMD as the initial step for extracting the intrinsic modes from the traffic sequence, thereby mitigating the impact of incidental noise. Then, LSTM is applied to fit each intrinsic mode individually. Additionally, considering the outer influencing factors, the attention mechanism is incorporated. Finally, all sub-prediction algorithms are neatly integrated as a whole prediction model. The proposed model is evaluated through simulation prediction using realistic VPP communication traffic data, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {The massive penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the grid are creating significant opportunities but also pose new challenges to the power system from an operational and market perspective. The key challenges concern the coordination of a very large number of small heterogeneous energy resources at the edge of the grid to enhance the resiliency of the system and their harmonization with grid operations while creating opportunities for the DER aggregators/owners for participating in hierarchical energy market structures. DERs could participate, individually or through aggregations, in the form of virtual power plants (VPPs) behind the meter (BTM) in wholesale energy markets consistent with the landmark Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 2222. This article proposes a comprehensive hardware and software methodology for integrating heterogeneous BTM DER smart devices into VPPs for wholesale energy market participation. Specifically, it proposes a methodology for calculating risk-based VPP energy offers via supply functions, designed to maximize the DER value from energy market participation. The supply functions are determined based on off-line sampling of actual DER usage data from actual installations of DER assets. © 2024 IEEE.},

The solution is flexible and caters to the diverse needs of stakeholders. It serves as a foundation for developing an optimal control solution for a residential distributed energy storage systems (ESS)-based VPP solution. A day-ahead scheduling using a novel hierarchical multi-objective optimization approach is developed for the ESS energy capacity and power budget allocation. The objectives are to simultaneously provide multiple local services,optimize the distributed ESS deployment,and provide the aggregator a clear visibility of the ESS remaining resources. This visibility of the features and use of remaining energy capacity and power budget will help the aggregator to create a virtual ESS that can be applied to provide additional services in the local and wholesale energy market. A focus on power-oriented applications provision is considered further; however,the results could be extended easily to other services. Real case studies utilizing data from the StoreNet project and complying with Irish energy market regulations further illuminate the discussion. The results obtained from employing different design methods are thoroughly examined,shedding light on their respective merits and limitations.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low-to-moderate income (LMI) households suffer from higher energy cost burden as they spend a larger portion of their income on electricity bills than higher-income households due to factors including limited access to renewable energy. Although distributed energy resources (DERs) can be owned by individuals, supposedly enabling energy justice, reality shows otherwise since it requires capital investment and property ownership. To mitigate these barriers, the paper proposes “Community Energy Cells” (CECs) which consists of a group of DERs and controllable loads in proximity, represented by a Cell Aggregator (CA) as a single controllable entity. CECs can operate independently during disruptions, deploy renewable energy to LMI households, and provide multiple value streams for their DERs, including the option to aggregate and sell in the wholesale energy market. A financial case study using National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System Advisory Model (SAM) was performed focusing on select buildings in West Harlem, New York City, with approximate 2.5 MW solar and 15 MW storage potentials. Considering that their CA benefits from investment tax credits, and the costs including installation and electricity purchase, it has a net present value of over $2 M, an internal rate of return of 35 % after 25 years, and sufficient cash flow to cover debt service. These returns are sensitive to key values: battery price and committed capacity for incentive programs for DERs and loads. The realization of CEC has interdisciplinary challenges that the paper elaborates on. Nevertheless, CEC is indispensable for tackling climate change and resiliency while attaining energy justice. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Great Britain (GB) government is paving the path to decarbonisation by actively promoting the integration of wind power into its generation mix. This sharp transition to renewable energy, however, introduces specific challenges. The characteristics of non-synchronous wind turbines have the potential to impact grid stability and frequency security due to the reduction in system inertia. In response to these challenges, the deployment of virtual power plants (VPPs) is envisioned in deregulated power systems, which allow for the aggregation and coordinated control of diverse distributed energy resources, enhancing grid flexibility, reliability, and efficiency. Moreover, VPPs offer the provision of system inertia and frequency response services at the national level. This study drops this assumption and leverages the localised flexibility inherent in VPPs to meet the ancillary service requirements of the low-carbon power system. The formulated problem is constructed as a non-convex bi-level optimisation problem, where the upper-level problem represents the operation of a frequency-constrained unit commitment model, and the lower-level problem embodies the energy dispatches and frequency responses of a group of VPPs, guided by the dual price signals of cleared energy and ancillary services. To address the non-convex nature of the unit commitment problem, a two-fold approach is employed. First, binary commitment status decision variables are relaxed to continuous versions. Subsequently, the duality gap between the original non-convex unit commitment problem and its relaxed dual form is minimised, yielding a solution closely approximating the optimal solution of the original problem. Second, the relaxed bi-level optimisation problem is transformed into a single-level mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints by replacing the lower-level VPP problems with their equivalent Karush-Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. The case studies conducted in this work encompass a comprehensive scope. Initially, the study evaluates the effectiveness of VPPs in delivering ancillary services within the projected context of the GB power system for 2030. The findings reveal a substantial 28.28% decrease in system operation costs when compared to the benchmark case lacking VPP flexibility. Additionally, the integration of VPPs leads to significantly lower price signals for inertia, primary frequency response, and enhanced frequency response, reduced by 81.21%, 79.13%, and 86.27%, respectively, in contrast to the benchmark case. The analysis then delves into a sensitivity exploration, investigating the inherent flexibility of VPPs. The profit of local VPPs is expected to increase with VPP flexibility. Finally, the study illustrates how VPPs can adapt to and derive benefits from an increasing level of wind power penetration by providing a higher amount of frequency response. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the pursuit of a near‑carbon-emission electric sector, concentrated solar power plants (CSP) and wind generators have gained prominence, promising dispatchable electricity for renewable-dominated grids. However, the existing studies focus on the coordinated scheduling of CSP and wind energy, overlooking the critical issue of energy pricing and trading. Moreover, a decentralized model for multiple networks that incorporate both CSP and wind generators, remains under-investigated. Accordingly, this paper proposes a fully decentralized distributionally robust transactive energy management (DRTM) framework for the energy trading, pricing and scheduling across multiple integrated wind-concentrated solar virtual power plants (IWC-VPP), using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This model allows each IWC-VPP operator to make independent decisions and share minimal information, ensuring privacy encryption. Based on the distributionally robust optimization (DRO), the DRTM framework can balance robustness and cost-effectiveness in making decisions under uncertainties. For efficient resolution, an adaptive buffer-column and constraint generation (AB-C&CG) algorithm is introduced, which reduces the complexity of the master problem compared to the traditional C&CG. Additionally, a varying penalty factor technique is integrated into ADMM to accelerate computation, and a two-block process is implemented to ensure finite convergence of the entire decentralized framework. Numerical studies on the three-VPP 25-Bus system and four-VPP 156-Bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed DRTM framework. The simulation results demonstrate the varying penalty factor technique bolsters computational efficiency by up to 46.51% for standard ADMM. Compared with the conventional C&CG, the AB-C&CG significantly reduces the computational consumption by 50.98%, and with the error <0.46%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources have become one of the important roles for sustainable energy development. One of the promising mechanisms to deploy renewable energy is through a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), which can integrate various distributed renewable energy resources into a single controllable and deployable entity. This paper examines the opportunity for VPP adoption in Indonesia, which investigates the minimum implementation criteria, provides a gap analysis for VPP implementation, and proposes recommendations for VPP implementation in Indonesia. The implementation criteria are obtained from the literature review, including the lessons learned from other countries, and categorized into four aspects: regulatory, technical, economic, and social. The gap analysis is performed by evaluating the current state of Indonesia’s utility network in correlation with the VPP minimum implementation criteria and then provides a scoring matrix for each criterion. Lastly, the recommendations are arranged to narrow these gaps, organized into ten key focus points, and divided into four phases, initiation, preparation, piloting, and deployment, across a ten-year timeframe. © 2024 by the authors.},

To address the issue, this work develops an optimal market model for VPPs when participating in both TSO-DSO coordinated energy and flexibility markets considering the renewables uncertainties. More specifically, the optimal participation model for VPPs consists of three sub-problems: market clearing at the transmission level directed by the TSO, market clearing at the distribution level managed by the DSO, and the optimization of VPPs operation strategies. Additionally, a distributed solution algorithm, alternating direction method of multipliers with self-adaptive penalty parameter (adaptive-ADMM), is employed to solve the proposed model and preserve multiple stakeholders' data privacy. The T30-D33 and T118-D85 + D2 × 69 test systems are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and solution method, the simulation results show the proposed model can reduce the operation cost for TSO, DSO, and VPPs, and the adaptive-ADMM can reduce the computational time by a 44.05%. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) offer an effective approach for managing distributed energy resources (DERs), including microturbines, distributed generators, demand response aggregators, and energy storage systems. This technology significantly enhances the economic efficiency and flexibility of distribution network systems. This study aims to facilitate a flexible power exchange between the distribution network system and the upper-level grid by aggregating the power flexibility of heterogeneous DERs via a VPP. Additionally, it introduces a methodology for optimal aggregation and disaggregation within a coordinated operation framework between the VPP and distribution network operator (DNO). On one hand, the VPP can determine its day-ahead feasible region and real-time flexible regulation power based on operational constraints of DERs and representative data provided by the DNO, circumventing the need for detailed network information. On the other hand, day-ahead and real-time correction procedures for the DER cost functions are proposed, effectively neutralizing the impact of network operational constraints on these cost functions. Consequently, precise cost functions for both the active power and the flexible regulation power aggregated by the VPP are derived. Employing this aggregated cost function enables the determination of a cost-minimized optimal scheduling solution in real-time by solving a fundamental economic dispatch problem, significantly alleviating computational demands. Finally, case studies demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an error in aggregated power of only 0.77%, compared to the precise computation method that requires comprehensive system information. The proposed optimal VPP disaggregation scheme exhibits power discrepancies of 0.63% and cost discrepancies of 0.91% relative to the precise method. Additionally, when implementing the most cost-effective demand response plan based on the proposed cost function, the average costs for aggregators are reduced by 19.7%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

It emphasizes the necessity for robust charging infrastructures, particularly in urban areas, and advocates for the integration of high-power charging (HPC) stations with energy storage systems. The discussion extends to the broader concept of 'smart cities', where battery electric systems find innovative applications in residential and urban settings. Renewable energy integration, decentralization, and the role of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are explored as key components of this convergence. Furthermore, the paper examines bidirectional charging technologies such as Vehicle-to-X (V2X), encompassing applications like Vehicle-to-Load (V2L), Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), Vehicle-to- Vehicle (V2V), and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). Standardization efforts, notably ISO 15118-20, are emphasized for seamless integration of V2X into smart city frameworks and VPPs. Additionally, the authors recognize the potential of renewable hydrogen for fuel cell systems. In conclusion, the paper advocates for digital, intelligent energy management systems that harmonize energy generation, transportation, and distribution with future mobility paradigms.

	abstract = {Amidst the escalating complexity of energy demands and climate concerns, natural calamities, and the Black Swan phenomenon have all presented formidable obstacles to the advancement and implementation of renewable energy sources. In light of the present backlog of studies in energy technology, the three primary issues identified and resolved in this study are inadequate analysis of the actual situation, absence of evidence of sustainable development, and flawed systematic methodology. This study proposes a novel renewable energy development initiative known as the circular economy and community-based virtual power plant (CE-cVPP). By integrating community participation and circular economy principles, this initiative aims to foster sustainable development and facilitate resilient progress. The principal focuses of the model are community renewable energy supply, energy demand, and community participation management. The sustainable framework is constructed upon the principles of circular economy theory. The systems engineering-based life cycle assessment (SE-LCA) method is proposed as an innovative approach to whole life cycle assessment that is grounded in systems engineering. Its purpose is to facilitate a systematic implementation and empirical evaluation of the sustainability of energy, the environment, and the economy. On the basis of disparities in renewable energy sources and a variety of spatiotemporal dimensions, CE-cVPP is categorised into four representative groups. We present a business community model for energy and environmental analysis that is based on a hospital in Harbin. The results suggest that the overall lifecycle primary energy conservation rate is 67.21%, which is an exceptional outcome that significantly promotes sustainable development in comparison to conventional methods. This improves environmental and human health protection as the full lifecycle emission reduction ratios for atmospheric pollutants are 53.50% (SO2-eq.), 51.69% (PM2.5-eq.), and 74.85% (CO2-eq.). Consideration is given to raw materials, equipment construction, equipment operation, tariffs on six pollutants, and material recycling when calculating the total cost. The annual total cost savings ratio for the full lifecycle is 54.21% when compared to the traditional system.

Therefore, it lacks incentives for them to participate in VPPs. This paper proposes a flexible VPP assembly approach to recruit DERs by energy service providers (ESPs). The contributions of each ESP and DER to VPPs are evaluated separately as the basis for a fair payoff allocation. Rebates are adopted to incentivize DER owners to participate in the VPPs. Based on the above fundamentals, a multi-ESP VPP assembly and competition method are proposed and simulated, considering diverse preference behaviors and electricity price fluctuations. The existence of the solution to the proposed multi-ESP VPP rebate competition problem is discussed. Case studies are conducted to simulate a 35-VPP assembly and disassembly process and a 6-ESP rebate competition process. The results indicate that DER owners are motivated to participate in VPPs with high payoffs, and the payoffs of ESPs increase by attracting more customers.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The arrival of virtual power plants (VPPs) marks important progress in the energy sector, providing optimistic solutions to the increasing need for energy flexibility, resilience, and improved energy systems’ integration. VPPs harness several characteristics to bring together distributed energy resources (DERs), resulting in economic gains and improved power grid reliability. Nevertheless, VPPs encounter major challenges when it comes to engaging in energy markets, mainly because there is no all-encompassing policy and regulatory framework specifically designed to accommodate their unique characteristics. This underscores the necessity for research endeavours to develop more advanced methods and structures for the long-term viability of VPPs. To address this concern, the study advocates for the implementation of a multi-aspect framework (MAF) as a systematic approach to thoroughly examine each aspect of virtual power plants (VPPs). A STEEP (social, technological, environmental, economic, and political) analytical tool is utilized to evaluate the challenges, opportunities, and benefits of a VPP in the existing energy markets. The proposed approach highlights important factors and actions that need to be taken to tackle the challenges related to VPP’ entry into energy markets. This study suggests that further support is required to promote the fast and widespread adoption of long-term VPP implementations. For this reason, a more favourable policy and regulatory framework based on social, technological, economic, environmental, and policy considerations is necessary to realize the genuine contributions of VPPs. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of distributed resources (DRs), developing an effective, profitable, and green management method is of great importance. Virtual power plant (VPP) can aggregate various DRs, optimize their schedules, and participate in electricity markets uniformly to earn profit. The optimal scheduling problem in spot market has been widely studied, however, few studies have extended the services of VPP to the long-term scale. This paper proposes a coordinated scheduling method for a multi-energy virtual power plant (MEVPP), considering the integration of hydrogen facilities. A holistic market framework, including capacity market, energy market (EM), and ancillary service market (ASM) is developed jointly for the coordination among the annual capacity schedule, daily energy schedule, and daily reserve schedule of MEVPP. A hybrid hydrogen storage system including daily hydrogen storage and seasonal hydrogen storage is modeled to achieve both intraday and cross-seasonal peak shaving. Stochastic programming is used to tackle the uncertainties and risk management is considered by conditional value at risk. With the help of numerical analysis in case studies, it can be concluded that the proposed coordinated scheduling method can improve the economy of MEVPP. The profit from joint market decreases the total cost by about 52 %. The capacity adequacy and flexibility of MEVPP can be improved by the coordination of capacity and reserve services. The hybrid hydrogen storage system can realize the efficient integration of hydrogen and increase hydrogen production and consumption by about 9 %. © 2024},

To solve the aggregation problem of a VPP containing scattered layouts and heterogeneous performance DERs, this study proposes a dynamic aggregation strategy to improve the flexible regulation ability of the VPP. A VPP aggregation model considering network constraints and temporal coupling constraints of DERs is constructed, while some VPP performance parameters are proposed to characterize and quantify the regulation ability. An uncertainty set considering time-series coupling properties of variables is constructed, and an aggregation method under uncertainty scenarios is proposed based on a two-stage robust optimization model. In addition, a dynamic aggregation strategy is proposed for the application of VPPs in electricity markets. Finally, case studies demonstrates that the proposed method provides a more extensive feasible region compared to other methods, and the deviation power remains within a reasonable range. The dynamic aggregation strategy facilitates the synergistic and correlative operation of DERs, exploits the regulation ability of the VPP in frequency regulation and spinning reserve, and improves the feasibility of practical applications.

	abstract = {With the continuous increase of demand-side penetration of solar power generation and energy storage systems, the power system is no longer able to directly and centrally manage the massive distributed energy resources (DERs). Moreover, the joint trading of electricity and carbon under the “dual carbon” target is becoming a trend. In this paper, the virtual power plant (VPP) modeling was first introduced to manage and control the massive heterogeneous DERs in adjacent geographical locations. Then, a low-carbon operation mode of the VPP based on emission arbitrage was proposed. Under the cooperative guidance of dynamic carbon-emission-factors and time-of-use electricity price from the grid, flexible loads are adjusted to participate in demand response activities. In addition, carbon emission arbitrage is carried out by changing the utilization time of renewable power using the storage system. Those two cooperative demand response actions can jointly contribute to the active low-carbon scheduling of VPPs. Finally, considering the resource complementarity characteristics among VPPs, an optimization model of multi-VPPs power-carbon joint trading under the low-carbon operation mode was developed. Such a model can motivate users to reduce the carbon actively with the goal of reducing operating costs and carbon emissions. The original-dual-ADMM distributed optimization algorithm was adopted for an iterative solution. The case study utilized the operation data of VPPs with 6 different DERs characterized by a typical hourly profile in northern China in a winter day, and the simulation results verified that the proposed model can effectively improve the economy and decarbonization of multi-VPPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Enabling the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the wholesale market, as prompted by the FERC Order 2222, introduces substantial operational complexities. To align with the current wholesale energy market practice, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) are pursuing the aggregation of transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), in which each T-DER is a projected representation of all DERs in the distribution network underneath the transmission node, such as a virtual power plant (VPP). This paper advances a realtime economic dispatch (RTED) framework to facilitate the aggregation of multiple T-DERs, optimizing their participation in energy market operations. We enhance the distribution factors (DFs) based modeling to capture the impact of individual TDERs across the transmission network. Specifically, an innovative DF updating strategy is introduced in our methodology, incorporating a tailored K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) predictor and a discrete PI corrector, along with transmission signals that sufficiently guarantee transmission constraints. These enhancements optimize the economic efficiency of the market clearing process, allowing numerous T-DERs to be involved in current energy market practices. The proposed method is tested on modified 24-bus and 118-bus systems via a rolling RTED process with real load data. The test results show that the proposed framework demonstrates marked improvements in minimizing system operation costs and satisfying the transmission network constraints.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As more uncontrollable renewable energy sources are present in the power generation portfolio, the need of more detailed and reliable tools for the optimal operation of energy systems has increased in the last years. This work presents a multi-stage stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program with binary recourse for optimizing the day-ahead unit commitment of power plants and virtual power plants operating in the day-ahead and ancillary services markets. Scenarios reproduce the uncertainty of the ancillary services market requests, and production of photovoltaic panels. A novel decomposition algorithm is proposed to tackle the challenging multistage stochastic program. The methodology is tested on three types of large power plants: a natural gas-fired combined cycle, a combined heat and power combined cycle with thermal storage, and a virtual power plant integrating a combined cycle with battery and photovoltaic fields. Compared to the typical deterministic unit commitment approach, the proposed stochastic optimization approach allows to increase the revenues of the conventional power plant up to 13.58% and, for the combined heat and power and virtual power plant case, it allows finding a feasible and efficient operational scheduling. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This will also bridge the gap between an electrical power utility and DERs behind the meter.

We tested the chip using a controller- and power-hardware-in-the-loop evaluation under three scenarios that a DERMS could face in the real world.

However, if well coordinated, smart homes, workplaces, and other locations that support EV charging could provide the grid with the urgently required flexibility via virtual power plants (VPP). In this paper, we develop the EV charging schedule model by capturing the unwillingness of EV drivers to alter their initial charging behaviors, referred to as the discomfort function. Predictability and the value of charging time, which represent the electricity consumption stability and the time value of EV drivers, characterize the discomfort function. Rather than existing works capturing discomfort by a direct simple parameter, such a computable data-driven quantification of discomfort enables us to customize an efficient VPP dispatch mechanism for EVs. In addition, to deal with the unknown charging efficiencies of EVs, we apply chance constraints only with the knowledge about mean and standard deviation of charging efficiencies, rather than their specific distribution. Using the concept of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), we build an effective algorithm to solve the practical non-convex VPP dispatch model considering charging efficiencies. The effectiveness of our proposed models and associated algorithms are validated by numerical studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Predictive control of solar homes with battery energy storage systems requires forecasts of key inputs including PV generation; residential load; and, under some tariff structures, wholesale electricity market price. Stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is a control strategy that incorporates uncertainty in forecasts to optimise system operation under a number of possible forecast scenarios. This study implements SMPC using a constrained approach where optimisation is performed simultaneously across all forecast scenarios rather than simply averaging all forecast scenarios. It also proposes a flexible scenario generation method that models the forecast errors in a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation which allows for any forecast to be used. This study quantifies the benefits of SMPC over deterministic MPC for six representative solar homes in Australia found using a clustering-based methodology. It finds that under all studied tariff structures, monthly electricity bill savings were in the range of 3-5 with only a small increase in computation time making it worthwhile for implementation within home energy management systems or virtual power plants.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Automated controllability in turn is necessary for installing sustainability in smart regions and cities. Ambient algorithmic support for decentralized process coordination will ease collaboration for a better utilization of available resources. Negotiation among software agents in such algorithms inevitably also demand an exchange of information; containing either plain information on local processes, resources or production states, or allow for deriving at least partial information. We analyze two use cases: virtual power plants for future smart grid coordination and automated network formation for smart regions. Based on the requirements of the algorithmic perspective as well as of the domain specific privacy needs, we derive recommendations for a possible solution that brings together these opposing perspectives.  © 2023 ACM.},

A technical virtual power plant (TVPP) operates the LFM in which the DER aggregators participate. The TVPP offers the provided flexibility capabilities to wholesale flexibility market (WFM) as well as compensating the intra-hourly variability in power distribution network. In the proposed framework, the TVPP clears the LFM by considering hierarchical transactions with the aggregator agents to find the market equilibrium in which the DERs’ flexibility capabilities are optimally exploited while all participating agents make profit by trading flexibility capabilities in the LFM. A bilevel optimization model with multiple lower levels is considered to address different agents’ preferences and transactions in the LFM. In the upper-level problem, the TVPP aims at maximizing its profit while each lower-level problem represents an aggregator agent's optimization problem. The proposed model is reformulated into a single-level mixed integer linear programming problem and is implemented on the distribution network connected to Bus 5 of the Roy Billinton test system (RBTS) as well as a 119-bus test system. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model to utilize DERs’ flexibility and provide revenue opportunities for different agents. © 2022 The Authors.

Most of these generation sources are non-conventional renewable energy sources, and one of the important common traits of all these DERs is that they are connected to the grid via a power electronic interface. These power electronic interfaces have decoupled the electro-mechanical dynamics of the source from the electrical dynamics of the power grid, which has resulted in reduced system inertia, and thus frequency stability. This paper has proposed a frequency support strategy using a virtual power plant (VPP) comprised of DERs located at the distribution feeder level. The frequency support strategy was developed considering several factors, such as BESS rating, state-of-charge (SoC) and fault-level at the DER location. The effectiveness of the control scheme has been proved under various operating scenarios and control conditions.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Firstly, in order to mitigate the burden of environmental pollution and balance the conflicting market interests of MVPP, this paper proposes a Stackelberg game strategy for the operator and MVPP considering a ladder-type carbon price mechanism and a dual-compensated demand response (DR) mechanism, which consists of an optimal pricing strategy for the operator and an optimal energy scheduling strategy for each VPP. During the game process, the operator serves as the leader, guiding the energy transactions of MVPP through price optimization, while each VPP acts as the follower, optimizing the internal aggregated units and loads based on the price issued. To solve the Stackelberg game equilibrium, a Kriging metamodel is then adopted to fit the energy scheduling model of the VPP. Finally, several cases are analyzed to verify that the proposed strategy can effectively contribute to the energy complementation and carbon reduction of MVPP. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The high-renewable-penetrated power system frequently requires frequency regulation services. By aggregating heterogeneous demand-side flexible resources, the virtual power plants (VPP) are able to quickly respond to the frequency regulation signal, enabling them promising frequency regulation service providers. However, due to the difference in ownership, it is unlikely that the self-interested demand-side resources are willing to follow the VPP-oriented dispatch results. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a decentralized game-based mechanism for the frequency regulation service provision inside the VPP. Firstly, the supply function-based bidding models of aggregated demand-side resources, namely, demand-side flexible resources and renewable distributed generations, are established. Then, a non-cooperative generalized Nash game for frequency regulation service provision is formulated. The existence, uniqueness, and competitive efficiency loss of the game are analyzed by designing an equivalent best response potential game of the original game. Additionally, a decentralized look-ahead real-time market clearing mechanism for frequency regulation service provision inside the VPP is proposed based on dual decomposition algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness and computation efficiency of the proposed method are validated in the case studies. Meanwhile, it is shown that the competition efficiency loss can be effectively reduced from around 80% to 6% when increasing the demand-side resource population from 20 to 2000 as well as balancing the demand-side resource composition. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In this article, an energy management system (EMS) was proposed to optimize the market participation and the real-time operation of a virtual power plant (VPP) composed of photovoltaic generators, non-flexible loads, and storage systems (e-vehicle, stationary battery, and thermal storage). The market bidding process was optimized through a two-stage stochastic formulation, which considered the day-ahead forecast uncertainty to minimize the energy cost and make available reserve margins in the ancillary service market. The real-time management of regulating resources was obtained through an innovative rolling horizon stochastic programming model, taking into account the effects of short-term uncertainties. Numerical simulations were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS. The architecture proved to be effective in managing several distributed resources, enabling the provision of ancillary services to the power system. In particular, the model developed allowed an increase in the VPP's profits of up to 11% and a reduction in the energy imbalance of 25.1% compared to a deterministic optimization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In this work, a methodology for a modified single-node model of a resistive EWH is proposed with improved internal tank temperature for user comfort modeling and capabilities for conservation voltage reduction (CVR) simulations as well as Energy Star and Consumer Technology Association communications protocol (CTA-2045) compliant controls, including energy storage calculations for “energy take”. Daily and weekly simulations are performed on a representative IEEE test feeder distribution system with experimental load and hot water draw (HWD) profiles to consider user comfort. Sequential controls are developed to reduce power spikes from controls and lead to peak shavings. It is found that EWHs are suitable for virtual power plant (VPP) operation with sustainable tank temperatures, i.e., average water temperature is maintained at set-point or above at the end of the control period while shifting up to 78% of EWH energy out of shed windows per day and 75% over a week, which amounts to up to 23% of the total load shifted on the example power system. While CVR simulations reduced the peak power of individual EWHs, the aggregation effect at the distribution level negates this reduction in power for the community. The EWH is shown as an energy constant load without consistent benefit from CVR across the example community with low energy reductions of less than 0.1% and, in some cases, increased daily energy by 0.18%. © 2023 by the authors.},

The relevant challenges include balancing conflict of interests among multiple energy entities, motivating users to adjust flexible loads, integrating multiple flexible resources in energy supply/demand sides and formulating specific policies, etc. To handle these tasks, an optimal operation strategy for MEMG participating in AS is proposed by considering Stackelberg game theory and integrated demand response (IDR).

	abstract = {This work presents a two-stage optimization model for virtual power plants (VPPs) consisting of interconnected microgrids (IMGs) with different load profiles, to provide demand-side frequency control ancillary services (D-FCAS). In the day-ahead scheduling stage, the hourly power consumption baseline and regulation capacity of the next day are predicted and rewarded by the market operator. In the real-time control stage, the dynamic regulation (RegD) signal from the grid is distributed according to the electricity unit price of each microgrid (MG), followed by a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mechanism among the MGs to reduce RegD-following violation of the VPP. Particularly, three P2P methods are designed and compared for P2P energy trading: (i) a multi-leader and multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game where the buyers are regarded as the leaders; (ii) a MLMF game where the sellers are the leaders; and (iii) a combinatorial auction mechanism (CAM) where buyers and sellers bid simultaneously. After the P2P energy trading is settled, the real-time power consumption control is coordinated locally inside each MG, to maximize the gross revenue of VPP. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is innovatively employed to obtain the optimal energy exchange solution in the P2P energy trading process, which is imported to each MG for local power control. Extensive simulations and comparative studies are conducted, and the numerical results show that the VPP with CAM P2P energy trading can reduce operating costs through superior RegD tracking performance compared to the VPP with other or no energy trading methods. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This opens up new possibilities in e.g. microgrid management, aggregation of distributed resources, peer-to-peer trading, integration of electromobility or proof-of-origin strategies. However, in order to benefit from those new possibilities, new challenges have to be overcome. This work focuses on one of these challenges, which is the need to ensure interoperability when integrating DLT-enabled devices in energy use cases. Firstly, the use of DLTs in the energy sector will be analyzed and the main use cases will be presented. Then, a classification of DLT-Energy use cases will be proposed. Secondly, the need for a common reference architecture framework to analyze those use cases with a focus on interoperability will be discussed and the current activities in research and standardization in this field will be presented. Finally, a new common reference architecture framework based on current activities in standardization will be presented.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The future power system will be characterized by many small decentralized power plants—so-called distributed energy resources (DERs). The integration of these DERs is vital from an economic and grid operation point of view. One approach to this is the aggregation of such DERs. The formation of coalitions as an aggregation method has already been examined in the literature and applied in virtual power plants, active distribution networks, and microgrids. The spread of DERs also increases the need for flexibility and dynamics in the power grid. One approach to address this can be overlapping coalitions. Therefore, in this paper, we first performed an analysis of related work and, in this context, found no work on overlapping coalitions for energy use cases in the literature. We then described a method for dynamic coalition formation, called dynamic coalition in electricity markets (DYCE), and analyzed how DYCE would need to be extended to include overlapping coalition formation. The extension includes the phases of product portfolio optimization and the actual coalition formation. Our analysis of DYCE shows that the methods used for the optimization of the DYCE sub-tasks are not suitable for overlapping coalitions and would have to be replaced by other methods in order to be able to form overlapping coalitions. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this context, the research questions would point out to the challenge of operating such systems, which would lead to complex operational optimization problems. Thus, this work proposes a grid operation methodology to optimally lure the flexibility potentials from the supply and demand sides by considering the active distribution network competence in utility management and its coexistence with industrial prosumers operating as virtual power plants.

This work investigates the optimal design of highly integrated CSP-PV power plants. The integration occurs not only at grid level (synergic operation as a virtual power plant), but also through the introduction of electric heaters, placed in parallel to the solar field: the excess PV electricity is converted into heat by electric heaters and stored in the CSP hot storage tank. The whole system design is optimized devising an ad hoc Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) which co-optimizes design and operational variables with accurate linearization of all nonlinear effects. Compared to the respective stand-alone technologies (only CSP or PV plus battery), the results show that the hybrid solutions can achieve similar or better dispatchability levels at a lower cost of electricity (LCOE reduction between −30% and −50%). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The coordination of energy and reserve services is realized by developing a holistic market framework. MEVPP trades electric energy in day-ahead market and natural gas in natural gas market under the uniform price scheme. MEVPP provides reserve in ancillary service market under the pay-as-bid scheme considering uncertain market clearing prices. Reserve regulations are modeled for the reserve quality provided by MEVPP. MEVPP can sign contracts in capacity market for capacity adequacy. The electricity and natural gas imbalance payments and unsupplied reserve penalty resulting from uncertain PV generation are calculated in real-time. The case studies, based on the practical data from Italian power exchange and transmission system operator, show the economic achievements of MEVPP with multiple markets participation. The advantages of multi-energy coupling in improving flexibility and economic profit are numerically analyzed. MEVPP is proven to be a promising reserve service supplier for TSO. Because through reasonable regulations, the reserve quality of MEVPP can be improved with little impact on its total cost. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

However, these data-driven models often require a prohibitive amount of data before reaching sufficient accuracy for individual devices. Centralized or collaborative learning schemes, which aggregate data from many devices, can lower data requirements from individual devices, but at the cost of loss of user privacy (or data leakage). In this paper, we explore federated learning as a modelling alternative to address these concerns, and compare its accuracy against collaborative learning approaches using a real-world dataset. Some important insights emerge from this work. Notably, we show that federated learning, on its own, suffers from several drawbacks when compared against collaborative approaches; including poor convergence in low data availability regimes, as well as a failure to learn causal links even asymptotically. We explore the reasons for these shortcomings, and demonstrate that these issues can be resolved by incorporating domain-informed data augmentation in the learning process, allowing it to converge to a solution that is very close to the baseline collaborative model in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Through ad vanced information communication and management system, virtual power plant (VPP) can realize the aggregation and coordination optimization of distributed energy, energy storage system, controllable load and other distributed energy resources. However, when making real-time price decisions according to users' demand response (DR) characteristics, the optimization effect of VPP is still limited by the evaluation accuracy of users’ DR potential and the computational burden of continuous decisions. By combining gate recurrent unit (GRU) and attention mechanism (AM), Neural Turing Machine (NTM) can extract users' response features in different environments and improve the accuracy of evaluating DR potential. Subsequently, based on the evaluation results, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm relying on prioritized experience replay (PER) is used to formulate a real-time electricity price plan. Ultimately, VPP achieves multi-objective optimization through DR management, which helps to increase the consumption amount of renewable energy resources, smooth its power fluctuation, and reduce users' electricity cost. Case study results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of the DR potential evaluation, reduce the response deviation to about 3%, and enhance the real-time decision calculation efficiency by 17%, which helps to optimize the smooth consumption of renewable energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

A communication-based independent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method is proposed to implement a partially observable Markov game for coordinating multiple VPPs (agents). The decentralized training process can protect the privacy of the agent-based entity participating in the framework, and each entity can share equal rights with simultaneous decision-making. Internal markets are proposed in our framework that the price contains the information of energy trading and network information. The price quota curve based external market is proposed for further exploiting distributed energy resource operation potential to enable VPPs with market power to be price-makers. The proposed method has been verified in a modified IEEE test system to prove its effectiveness. The results confirm that the proposed framework can simultaneously improve the operation cost and maintain network operational safety.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For the scheduling problem of virtual power plants (VPPs), this paper aims to propose a dynamic trigger scheduling strategy that integrates objective grid information and subjective judgment factors affecting VPP scheduling. The strategy design involves setting initial incentive electricity prices and optimizing price adjustment efficiency. Firstly, this paper establishes a reference incentive electricity price model to derive the initial reference electricity price for the dispatching process. Then, a response willingness model is proposed to establish the relationship between electricity price and VPP response, improving the accuracy of the initial reference electricity price and reducing the frequency of subsequent price adjustments in the actual trigger. Finally, this paper utilizes the groundbreaking dynamic trigger method to adjust the price based on the actual VPP response, obtaining the optimal VPP incentive electricity price. We use Matlab to verify this strategy, and the experimental results show that the average response error using this strategy is reduced by 3.33 kW compared to the contrastive literature. Moreover, scheduling task non-completion does not occur in this method. Thus, the accuracy and reliability of the method are verified. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Global warming, air pollution, and the need for energy has led to the growth of renewable energy sources (RESs) around the world. Despite the fact RESs offer less expensive energy to customers, uncertainty in their output power, along with other sources of uncertainty inherent in power systems operations such as market price and load forecast, creates an imbalance between demand and supply. The virtual power plant (VPP) has been recognized as a solution that can integrate RESs into the power system to help deal with uncertainty. VPP operators require a flexible power system to address the supply and demand imbalance by rescheduling energy resources. In this study, coordinated scheduling of flexible resources in the form of a VPP participating in a day-ahead (DA) market is presented. Flexible resources and components include fast ramping conventional generators (CGs), battery energy storage systems, dispatchable wind turbines equipped with compressed air tanks, lines equipped with dynamic line rating (DLR) technology, and a flexible demand response program. In addition, flexibility indices (FI) are provided for each flexible component to capture each component's impact on system flexibility. The proposed model is a mixed integer linear program (MILP) implemented on the IEEE standard 33 bus system. The result of the study show that the system equipped with DLR technology increases VPP profit when compared to the system with static line rating by 23%. The 24-hour average system's FI indicated an increase in operational flexibility by the proposed model. Finally, the energy generated by each flexible resource is compared for different cases. The results indicates an increase in power sold to the upstream network by the VPP and a decrease in the need for load shedding. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, a three-stage bi-level stochastic programming approach is proposed for joint energy and reserve scheduling of a virtual power plant (VPP). In this framework, the VPP can provide demand response (DR) services and reserve capacity from external DR providers (DRPs) by participating in a local intraday demand response exchange (IDRX) market and trading with internal load aggregators (LAs). The VPP tries to reach a proper balance between allocating spinning reserve and DR services to reduce the penalty cost resulting from the difference between the day-ahead (DA) scheduled power and the real-time dispatched. To this end, a bi-level problem is formulated, in which at the upper level the objective of the VPP is to maximize its profit, and in the lower level, the LAs maximize their social welfare. The interaction between the VPP and the LAs is modelled as a Stackelberg game; then, by reformulating the lower-level problem using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions, a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is achieved. The intended problem is converted into a convex mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP) by applying the strong duality theorem. Simulation results demonstrate that providing DR services from the internal LAs and the local IDRX market noticeably affects the VPP's decisions improving the profit by more than 7% and reducing the imposed imbalance penalty in the balancing market by nearly 50%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Neighbourhood batteries (100-1,000kWh) are new type of mid-scale storage with potential advantages over uncoordinated household batteries. They have attracted strong interest from the energy industry and energy users in recent years, with cited benefits including increased economies-of-scale and hosting capacity, easier provision of network services and potentially greater impacts on emissions reduction. Here we examined the potential impacts of neighbourhood batteries compared to coordinated and uncoordinated household batteries on cost reductions, local solar utilisation, average peak demand, and emissions reduction in the Australian context, using real prices, load, and solar PV data. Three battery operation modes were modelled: revenue maximisation (RM), solar maximisation (SM) and a balanced mode. In SM mode, the neighbourhood battery and the virtual power plant reduced average daily peak demand by 82% more than household batteries. Two real trial neighbourhood battery tariffs were tested and the outcomes for the grid were very similar. Neighbourhood batteries and virtual power plants offer similar benefits for the grid and similar financial benefits for households. Neighbourhood batteries offer further benefits for households in terms of alleviating the need for householders to purchase and manage their own battery storage systems. © 2023 IEEE.},

By deploying the community energy storage system (CESS) and the community peer-to-peer (P2P) market, prosumers can form energy communities to achieve self-sufficiency of energy and independence from fuel-based power generators. This article proposed a two-stage community energy trading model under end-edge-cloud orchestration. The community P2P trading is the first stage where the edge server can execute the automatic bidding process for multiple buyers and sellers based on the real-time users' energy profiles and the Bayesian-game-based pricing mechanism. The trading between the retailer and energy communities is the second stage where the edge server can dynamically update the optimal operation of the CESS based on the dynamic pricing mechanism. An original centralized optimization problem is decomposed into subproblems for each stakeholder and solved through the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Considering ADMM needs multiple information exchanges, a general form of the communication-censored ADMM for sharing problems is proposed to decrease the communication cost. Numerical simulations prove that the proposed mechanism can effectively increase transaction efficiency, avoid the new demand peak brought by the utilization of the CESS, and decrease the communication cost.  © 2014 IEEE.},

This paper studies how to calculate FR for DERs based on a linear unbalanced three-phase power flow model while considering uncertainties from measured/estimated line impedances, leading to the robust feasible region (RFR). With an initialised FR, the proposed solution algorithm aims to seek the RFR by solving a non-convex bilinear problem, formulated based on Motzkin Transposition Theorem, and updating the RFR alternately until reaching convergence.

The approach addresses challenges related to integrating renewable energy sources and achieving energy efficiency. An RL-based VPP system is trained and tested under different scenarios, and a case study is conducted in a real-world urban environment. The proposed approach achieves multi-objective optimization by performing actions such as load-shifting, demand offsetting, and providing ancillary services in response to demand, renewable generators, and market signals. The study validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under complex environmental conditions. Results demonstrate that the approach provides optimized decisions in various urban environments with different available resources and supply-demand profiles.

One particular type of DERMS using primal–dual control has recently been found to be very effective at providing multiple grid services among an aggregation of DERs; however, the main parameter, the primal–dual step size, must be manually tuned for the DERMS to be effective, which can take a considerable amount of engineering time and labor. To this end, we design a simple method that self-tunes the step size(s) and adapts it to changing system conditions. Additionally, it gives the DER management operator the ability to prioritize among possibly competing grid services. We evaluate the automatic tuning method on a simulation model of a real-world feeder in Colorado with data obtained from an electric utility. Through a variety of scenarios, we demonstrate that the DERMS with automatically and adaptively tuned step sizes provides higher-quality grid services than a DERMS with a manually tuned step size. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

A prototype DERMS dispatches residential battery energy storage systems (BESS) based on real-time optimal power flow to provide additional peak demand reduction. The DERMS also maintains voltage regulation across the feeder by controlling both residential batteries and rooftop PV systems. The results from the controller-hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) real-time simulations conducted in a realistic laboratory environment show that the coordinated operation of the ADMS and the DERMS effectively achieves peak demand reduction while enforcing voltage regulation across the feeder. Specifically, the ADMS dynamic voltage regulation (DVR) application and DERMS working together achieved a peak demand reduction of nearly 500 kW, whereas the ADMS DVR application alone obtained a reduction of approximately 100 kW. The DERMS VPP control in this work relies on the residential BESS for the demand reduction; the demand reduction accomplished depends on the BESS capacity available in the distribution system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is being considered as an important option to contribute to energy system decarbonization. However, currently its production from renewables is expensive compared with the methods that utilize fossil fuels. This paper proposes a comprehensive optimization-based techno-economic assessment of a hybrid renewable electricity-hydrogen virtual power plant (VPP) that boosts its business case by co-optimizing across multiple markets and contractual services to maximize its profits and eventually deliver hydrogen at a lower net cost. Additionally, multiple possible investment options are considered. Case studies of VPP placement in a renewable-rich, congested area of the Australian network and based on real market data and relevant sensitivities show that multi-market participation can significantly boost the business case for cleaner hydrogen. This highlights the importance of value stacking for driving down the cost of cleaner hydrogen. Due to the participation in multiple markets, all VPP configurations considered are found to be economically viable for a hydrogen price of 3 AUD $/kg (2.25 USD $/kg), which has been identified as a threshold value for Australia to export hydrogen at a competitive price. Additionally, if the high price volatility that has been seen in gas prices in 2022 (and by extension electricity prices) continues, the flexibility of hybrid VPPs will further improve their business cases.  © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.},

However, existing research rarely concerns the cooperation between VPPs and CSs that are managed by different stakeholders. To facilitate the cooperation between VPPs and CSs, this work proposes a cooperative operation framework for a multi-stakeholder VPP-CSs system. In the proposed cooperative framework, day-ahead offering and real-time balancing models are developed to maximize the total benefit of the VPP-CSs system. To support a more flexible operation of the VPP-CSs system with EV energy flexibility, an EV user incentive program is proposed for acquiring EV battery access rights. The conflicting interests of different stakeholders are addressed by a τ -value cost allocation method. To alleviate the computational burden in calculating the τ -values, a maximum right cost estimation approach is proposed. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods can provide superior performance by increasing 4.6% of VPP profit, increasing 20.7% of CS profit, reducing 16.3% of EV user charging fees, and achieving 99.2% of τ -value estimation accuracy.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increasing penetration of primarily inertia-less distributed energy resources, allowable delay in the fast frequency reserve provision to ensure marginal stability condition can become comparable with the requisite dead-time for fast-switching in a radial power distribution system (PDS) connected to the transmission system. Consequently, the prevailing short-duration load-generation imbalance might propagate as system-wide frequency excursion in the future power system, which traditionally has not been observed. Furthermore, during the fast-switching, some of the fast-acting reserve (FAR) providing local generators remain inaccessible to the bulk power system (BPS). This work has answered the questions of requisite reserve requirements to cater to such events through efficient energy and FAR provision joint-scheduling. Stochasticity of fast-switching, with temporary faults as a use-case, requires modeling of load-generation imbalance and local resource unavailability, vis-á-vis FAR requirement problem, as a chance-constraint. Due to the limited visibility at the BPS level, PDS operators must ensure sufficient FAR availability for a given confidence level of the chance-constraint. Individual chance-constraints are used to ensure mathematical simplicity. Here, the PDS is operated as a virtual power plant (VPP), where the operator can procure resources locally or from the wholesale market with the aim of profit maximization before the contingency occurs. Results show that FAR requirements can influence the local energy schedule and raise energy costs. Furthermore, the confidence level of the chance-constraint can impact overall profitability, and FAR should be scheduled carefully. Comparative analysis with a modified benchmark IEEE 33-node radial test system and a 98-node test system shows the superior performance of the proposed approach. The impact of the limited available FAR is also demonstrated.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The approach introduced by this research framework focuses on the integration of two roles, the fleet operator and the energy aggregator. They form the EV VPP by exchanging data about the fleets, to control charging sessions to respond to market signals. Proposed is the optimized purchasing of energy and the application of vehicle-to-grid (V2G).

To effectively exploit the flexibility and economy of DERs, this study proposed a novel method to aggregate DERs belonging to different stakeholders into a VPP based on a Nash-Stackelberg game. The DER-based generators act as leaders in the game and decide their output to maximize profits, while the VPP acts as a follower on the lower level to maximize the profit in the market. Moreover, the network constraints and uncertainties are considered in the lower model. Subsequently, a method to find the Pareto-optimal equilibrium points is proposed. The bi-level model can be transformed into a single-level model via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Thus, the proposed Nash-Stackelberg game model is transformed into a non-cooperative multi-objective optimization problem. Furthermore, the Nash equilibrium point can be obtained by the modified column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, case studies demonstrated that the method can efficiently find the Nash equilibrium solution of the VPP aggregation model and provide more comprehensive Nash equilibrium points than other methods. Moreover, the distribution of Nash equilibrium points can be used to guide the dispatching scheme of the VPP. © 2023 IEEE.},

To maximize the benefits of these assets, DER can be aggregated in a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and operated as a single system. In this work we consider a VPP given by the aggregation of a cascade of hydropower stations (CHPS) connected at the High-Voltage (HV) grid and integrating a large portfolio of variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) connected at Medium-Voltage (MV) grids. Then, we tackle the problem of VPP profit maximization on the joint energy and ancillary services market, under complex technical constraint, safety constraints and unavailability of VPP resources due to faults. First, we propose a generic model of the VPP. Second, we present a two-level sequential VPP energy management strategy composed by long-term bidding optimization and real-time control via Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), both receiving forecast as input. Simulations employ realistic models and real forecast provided by the French aggregator Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR). Compared to traditional Reference Tracking MPC (RTMPC), the EMPC increases by 6% the VPP profit and enhances the provision of ancillary services when faults occur. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2023.},

	abstract = {The Energy Trading System is a platform that enables energy providers to participate in the trading market and gain profits. Historically, traditional energy sources such as coal-fired power plants, natural gas-driven power plants, and nuclear power plants have held a dominant position in the energy market. However, since the 2000s, the development of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), including solar panels and wind generators, has given rise to the concept of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) and microgrids. These systems aggregate DERs for active participation in the energy market. In recent years, some aspects of Web 3.0, including AI and blockchain, have been incorporated into VPPs and microgrids. Nevertheless, the evolution of the new Energy Trading System is 'Web 3.0-like' but may not fully embody the spirit of Web 3.0 which aims to create a more open, equitable, and collaborative online ecosystem that empowers individuals. This article addresses issues, such as the transparency challenge, that run counter to the Web 3.0 spirit and proposes a framework for an open Energy Trading Market based on Web 3.0 principles to resolve these challenges.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To realize the national strategies for carbon emission reduction, electric power industries should undergo reforms to cope with the multiple challenges of decarbonization, marketization, and energy transition. How to design a dispatch strategy that considers both low-carbon demand and economic cost has become a major concern in integrated energy systems. To realize multi-energy complementation and low-carbonization, a scheduling framework of combined heat and power-virtual power plants (CHP-VPPs) considering carbon capture and power-to-gas is proposed. The stochastic dynamic optimization problem is modelled as a Markov decision process. An improved deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm named multi-level backtracking prioritized experience replay-twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBEPR-TD3) is employed to solve the low-carbon economic dispatch problem. The results show that: (1) The profits have been increased by 85.8% and carbon emissions have been reduced by 30.3% because of the addition of power-to-gas in CHP-VPP; (2) the revenues have been improved by 22.24% and carbon emissions have been decreased by 37.04% owing to the introduction of carbon capture and trading; (3) compared with results using DQN, DDPG, and TD3, the optimal dispatch strategy obtained by MBEPR-TD3 has higher reward returns and more stable convergence. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The global transition to a renewable-powered economy is gaining momentum as renewable energy becomes more cost-effective and energy-efficient. Renewable-energy-integrated Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are capable of facilitating renewable transition, reducing distributed generator impacts, and creating value for prosumers and communities by producing renewable energy, engaging in the electricity market, and providing electricity network functions. In this paper, we conducted a case study in the City of Greater Bendigo to evaluate the challenges and opportunities of the community-focused renewable energy transition through establishing VPP with community-based renewable generators and storage systems. A reinforcement learning algorithm was formulated to optimise the energy supply, load shifting, and market trading in the VPP system. The proposed VPP system has great potential to improve the economic value and carbon emission reduction performance of local renewable resources: it can reduce 50–70% of the case study city’s carbon emissions in 10 years and lower the electricity price from the current range of 0.15 AUD/kWh (off-peak) −0.30 AUD/kWh (peak) as provided by Victorian Essential Services Committee to 0.05 AUD/kWh (off-peak) (peak). Overall, this study proposed a comprehensive framework to investigate community-based VPP in a complex urban environment and validated the capability of the VPP in supporting the renewable transition for Australian communities. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, the uncertainties in energy sources and loads bring adverse impact on the operation of MEVPP. Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead robust bidding strategy for MEVPP to participate in the peak-regulation market. Firstly, this paper analyzes the impact of uncertainties for MEVPP on the peak-regulation market. On this basis, the operation mechanism for MEVPP in the peak-regulation market is proposed by considering the integrated demand response (IDR). Additionally, the day-ahead two-stage robust bidding model is established to minimize the operation cost of MEVPP. Finally, the case studies show that the day-ahead robust bidding strategy can effectively reduce the peak-regulation deviation penalty compared with traditional deterministic optimization. Specifically, with the proposed robust bidding strategy, the total revenue in the actual operation stage is increased by 5.16% and 8.45% on sunny day and raised by 8.28% and 15.35% on cloudy day when the predicted deviations are respectively 20% and 30%, comparing with traditional deterministic optimization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Achieving these potential benefits will require the implementation of new business models to address limitations of existing market structures. One promising area of research involves the use of decentralised energy trading markets. These markets can increase renewable energy generation through improved infrastructure utilisation and financial returns. However, facilitating these markets is challenging due to the constraints of physical laws and energy losses. The model presented in this paper addresses these challenges by demonstrating an energy market structure for local energy trading that accounts for physical constraints and losses. It fairly allocates the gains of trade and incentivises agents to minimise distribution losses. This market structure can be implemented with existing metering data and approximate values of electrical distribution network properties. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {As a transitional layer between the electricity market and prosumers, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) can effectively integrate distributed resources of prosumers to participate in the electricity market to improve the energy economy for prosumers. This study aggregates distributed resources such as photovoltaics, energy storage, and flexible loads into a VPP within the same community microgrid. A two-layer peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing model within and among VPPs is established to consume PV power and construct a stable power supply system. At the VPP-layer, a comprehensive energy management model is created to optimize the scheduling of flexible loads to achieve optimal energy economic performance of the community. At the market-layer, a VPP bidding model is established to organize P2P energy sharing among VPPs. The VPP-layer scheduling provides initial information for the marketlayer to participate in energy sharing, and energy sharing results of the market-layer are fed back to the VPP-layer as boundary conditions for re-scheduling. The energy economy analysis of the proposed system shows that the community’s cost is reduced by participating in P2P sharing, and the two-layer interactive mechanism can further reduce the community’s cost by increasing the quantity of shared energy in the P2P market, achieving dual technological and economic benefits. © 2023, Scanditale AB.

	abstract = {The increasing share of renewable energy sources (RESs) in electricity generation leads to increased uncertainty of generation, frequency and voltage regulation as well as difficulties in energy management. A virtual power plant (VPP), as a combination of dispersed generator units, controllable load and energy storage system (ESS), provides an efficient solution for energy management and scheduling, so as to reduce the cost and network impact caused by the load spikes. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) of battery energy storage system (BESS) for VPP applications. A low-voltage (LV) network in Alice Springs (Northern Territory, Australia) is considered as the test network for this study. The BESS for each customer is used to store and release the energy when required to maintain the voltage regulation performance of the LV network and reduce the cost. To optimize the charge/discharge schedule in each battery, a multi-objective optimization tool (MOOT) is developed, where MOO can directly communicate with DIgSILENT PowerFactory platform to perform multi-time scale simulation. MOO mainly focuses on generating a set of trade-off schedule solutions for each customer over 24 h by considering the customer's cost and network impact. Then according to the stakeholder's prior preference, one of the solutions is selected and verified in DIgSILENT PowerFactory with a realistic LV network. We also design several scenarios with different penetrations of photovoltaics (PVs) and batteries to verify how they influence customer's cost and LV network. With the increasing penetrations of PVs and batteries, the experimental results over the selected solution according to the customer preference show that the customers’ cost can be largely reduced by maintaining the network voltage regulation performance. © 2023 The Author(s)},

In particular, the first stage, day-ahead scheduling, is carried out to predict the hourly electricity consumption baseline and regulation capacity for the next day, the latter of which results in a reward from the market operator. In the second stage, real-time power consumption control is performed by following the dynamic regulation (or RegD) signal. The second stage is further divided into two layers: the upper layer distributes demand response (DR) signals from the main grid according to the electricity unit price of each microgrid (MG) and exchanges electricity among MGs based on a new energy sharing mechanism to reduce RegD-following violations. The lower layer performs real-time power consumption control for each MG to minimize operation costs. The overall goal is to maximize the reward in the day-ahead stage and minimize the RegD-following violation penalty in the real-time stage, so as to minimize the overall operation cost of the VPP. The optimization is written in five objective functions, which are solved using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) in Gurobi solvers. Extensive simulation and comparison studies are carried out, and numerical results show that compared with traditional MG operations, VPPs comprised of IMGs can reduce operation costs and provide better frequency support for the grid through superior RegD signal following performances.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) are an effective platform for attracting private investment and customer engagement to speed up the integration of green renewable resources. In this paper, a robust bidding strategy to participate in both energy and ancillary service markets in the wholesale electricity market is proposed for a realistic VPP in Western Australia. The strategy is accurate and fast, so the VPP can bid in a very short time period. To engage customers in the demand management schemes of the VPP, the gamified approach is utilized to make the exercise enjoyable while not compromising their comfort levels. The modelling of revenue, expenses, and profit for the load-following ancillary service (LFAS) is provided, and the effective bidding strategy is developed. The simulation results show a significant improvement in the financial indicators of the VPP when participating in both the LFAS and energy markets. The payback period can be improved by 3 years to the payback period of 6 years and the internal rate of return (IRR) by 7.5% to the IRR of 18% by participating in both markets. The accuracy and speed of the proposed bidding strategy method is evident when compared with a mathematical method. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Solar module prices have dramatically dropped in recent years, which in turn has facilitated distributed solar energy resources (DSERs) in smart grids. To manage electricity real time supply and demand, the utilities has shown the strong interest in deploying virtual power plants(VPPs) which enable solar generated energy trading to reduce the intermittent DSERs impact in electric grid. Unfortunately, the current energy trading approaches in residential VPPs typically require a trusted third party to take on the role of the middleman, DSER users are not allowed to trade their surplus solar energy independently and simultaneously to maximize potential benefits. In addition, these approaches do not achieve "fair"for both VPPs and DSERs users. To address this issue, we build a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based peer to peer (P2P) new solar energy trading system-SolarTrader+, which enables unsupervised, distributed, and long term fair solar energy trading in residential VPPs. We apply deep reinforcement learning with neural networks as Q-value function approximator.We implement SolarTrader+ and evaluate it using data from U.S. residential VPP communities that are comprised of - 119 residential DSERs. Our results show that SolarTrader+ can reduce the aggregated VPP energy consumption by 83.8% when compared against a non-trading approach. © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

In the paradigm of the Virtual Power Plant, a structure which aggregates the output of multiple Distributed Energy Resources and connects to the grid as one entity, it is particularly challenging to prioritize those security controls and countermeasures that measurably improve its security posture. Assessing and framing cyber risk is critically important to enable such endeavors.

Increasing levels of renewable generation further incentivizes shifting loads in time through controls and energy storage to reduce curtailment and carbon footprint. This paper proposes techniques for the optimization and control of distributed energy resources (DER) using DERMS. The CTA-2045 standard, an industry communications protocol, is used for generalized energy storage (GES) controls and operations. A case study is conducted to compare discharging of residential BESS with HVAC equivalent energy storage controls and electric vehicles (EV) on a distribution feeder with over 350 houses, realistic load profiles, and home characteristics. It is shown that HVAC setpoint controls for pre-cooling through "load-up"and "shed"commands may successfully reduce evening peak load. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy companies and new aggregation businesses have recently promoted Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to solve many problems in energy systems by aggregating and coordinating rooftop solar and household batteries to act in unison. If successful, they could support deployment of renewable generation into electricity distribution networks and enable households to access multiple value streams for their assets, through participation in markets for wholesale energy and system services and payments for network support. However, while residential battery purchase may be more financially attractive if combined with VPP participation, households remain cautious about participation. This paper examines the social factors behind this gap between industry promise and the very low household uptake of VPPs in Australia. We present the key findings from a qualitative study (n = 47) of Australian residential energy users' motivations towards, and conditions for, participation in a hypothetical battery-based virtual power plant. We find that users' willingness to participate in a VPP is affected by their motivations for solar and battery purchase. In particular, VPP participation can conflict with goals of independence from the grid and security of supply. Furthermore, the financial benefits may be more attractive to households who have not already embarked on a ‘sustainability journey’ by purchasing solar and/or a battery. We also find that environmental and social benefits can help motivate VPP participation, provided transparency and fairness in the distribution of benefits are assured through regulation or operation by a trusted broker. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In small communities, such as small islands, campuses of universities/industrial parks/lab facilities, and remote villages/cities, the Water-Energy Nexus (WEN) operators generally need to purchase electricity from the power grid to meet a portion of their power demand. The WEN of these communities creates new opportunities of providing virtual energy storage (VES) and virtual power plant (VPP) services to the power grid by properly controlling their electricity-driven water facilities (EDWF). This paper investigates the capacity of EDWFs in small communities as VES and VPP. Small communities in four different types of areas, e.g., island, desert, urban, and rural, are studied based on their geographical specifications, to evaluate and compare the capabilities of their WENs as VES and VPP respectively. WENs with high penetration of photovoltaic resources are considered, for which battery energy storage systems (BESS) are needed. An optimization approach of operating the EDWFs as VES is proposed to reduce the required size of BESSs. The state-of-the-art convex technologies are adopted to reduce the computational burden of the developed optimization models which are large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems. Besides, the WEN of small communities is modeled as a VPP to provide spinning reserve energy for the power grid in emergency conditions. This paper also describes how the EDWFs can be controlled to serve as a virtual system and provides substantial benefits for the small communities. Numerical results validate that it is economically beneficial to operate the WENs of small communities as VES or VPP for renewable energy management of power grids. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The virtual power plant (VPP) breaks the geographical restrictions of environment and resource types by virtue of aggregating the distributed energy resources and dispatchable loads. In view of the impact of large-scale energy consumption by users on the operational safety of VPP, based on the existing demand response (DR) researches, this paper adds a penalty mechanism for the reasonable management of loads. For the difference of resources in multiple VPPs, the current researches ignore the energy interaction between different VPPs, and the external operator is introduced innovatively in this paper to coordinate the real-time complementation of regional energy. Considering the uncertainty from renewable energy and load, a two-stage scheduling strategy for VPP with multi-time scale optimization is proposed, including a long-time scale day-ahead scheduling and a short-time scale real-time scheduling. On the basis of DR and unit constraints, the resource scheduling plan is formulated in the day-ahead stage. In the real-time stage, the energy complementation between VPPs is considered under the framework of rolling optimization for the correction of the previous plan. The scheduling of both stages is aimed at the economic operation of the VPP. Simulation results show that the DR flexibly optimizes the load distribution while bringing economic benefits, and the total profit can be increased by up to 6.65%. Moreover, the results show that the energy interaction under the external operator coordination significantly reduces the total correction cost by up to 8.23%, and the correction cost is decreased with the extension of the rolling optimization scheduling period. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs) that utilize vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies can function as both controllable loads and virtual power plants, providing key energy management services to the distribution system operator (DSO). EVAs can also balance the grid’s reactive power as a virtual static VAR compensator (SVC) and provide voltage stability by utilizing advanced electric vehicle (EV) chargers that are capable of four-quadrant operations to provide reactive power management. Finally, managed charging can benefit EVAs themselves by minimizing power factor penalties in their electricity bills. In this paper, we propose a novel EV charging scheduling algorithm based on a hierarchical distributed optimization framework that minimizes peak load and provides reactive power compensation for the DSO by collaboration with EVAs that manage both the active and the reactive charging and discharging power of participating EVs. Utilizing the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the proposed distributed optimization approach scales well with increased EV charging infrastructure by balancing active and reactive power while decreasing computational burden. In our proposed hierarchical approach, each EVA schedules the active and reactive EV charging and discharging power for 1) reactive power compensation in order to minimize power factor penalty and electricity cost accrued by the EVA, 2) satisfaction of each EV’s energy demand at minimal charging cost, and 3) peak shaving and load management for the DSO. When compared with an uncoordinated charging model, the efficacy of this proposed model is successfully demonstrated through a 300% decreased peak EV load for the DSO, 28% lower electricity costs for EV users, and 98.55% smaller power factor penalty, along with 17.58% lower overall electricity costs, for EVAs. The performance of our approach is validated in a case study with 50 EVs at multiple EVAs in an IEEE 13-bus test case and compared the results with uncoordinated EV charging.

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources (RESs) are becoming more prevalent as a source of clean energy, and their integration into the power market is speeding up. The fundamental reason for this is the growing global concern about climate change. However, their weatherdependent and uncertain nature raise questions about grid reliability particularly, when photovoltaics (PVs) and wind turbines (WTs) technologies are used. As a result, rationally managing Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) under the virtual power plant (VPP) setting is being encouraged as a way of minimizing the impact of the uncertain nature of renewable energies. A VPP is comparatively a new concept that aggregates the capacities of dispatchable and non-dispatchable energy sources, electrical loads, and energy storage systems for the purpose of improving energy supply and demand imbalance. It enables individual consumers and producers to participate in the power markets. In this study, a new market-based (MB)-VPP operational planning model is designed and developed with the aim to evaluate the optimal active power dispatched by (WT, PV, and ESS) operating in the day-ahead power market to maximize the social welfare (SW) of the market. SW can be described as the maximization of the consumer’s benefit function minus the cost of energy generation. The optimization process was carried out by using a scenario-based approach to model the uncertainties of renewable energy sources (i.e, WTs & PVs) and load demand. The proposed model and method performance is validated by simulation studies on a 16-bus UK generic distribution system (UKGDS). The simulation results reveal that the proposed approach maximizes overall system social welfare. The capacity of total active power dispatched by (WT, PV, and ESS) has a positive impact on the VPP profit maximization. This empirical study could be used as a reference baseline model for other energy services providers interested in conducting similar research in the future. © 2022, Diponegoro university Indonesia - Center of Biomass and Renewable Energy (CBIORE).

The yearly operating and investment costs of renewable and flexible resources subjected to model of resources in FRVPP framework are minimized in the lower-level problem. Then, the bi-level problem is converted into a single-level formulation using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approach to obtain the optimum solution through classical mathematical solvers. The scheme combines the adaptive robust optimization approach to consider uncertainties of renewable production, energy price, and demand. Ant-lion optimizer algorithm is utilized due to the nonlinearity of problem. In worst-case scenario, this process provides a robust optimal solution with estimated unique response conditions.

The dynamic response performance (DRP) indicators are developed based on the wide-range transport model. Then the RTC strategy considering the different response characteristics of ACCs under different rules is developed. Besides, the control preference matrix is designed to reduce the repeated switch actions of the controller. The proposed RTC strategy could take consideration the inherent DRP of ACCs, and it could track the hour-level power increase or decrease curve stably. It could also reduce the switch number significantly. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2023 IEEE.},

The constraints in the problem formulation are the AC optimal power flow equations, flexibility limits in the network, and the operating model of CVEs. Further, the design is in a nonlinear formulation, which is followed by a linear approximation model to access a unique optimal response. Stochastic optimization is used to account for uncertainties in energy price, load, renewable power, and energy consumption of mobile storage devices. In addition, the results from implementing the design on the IEEE 69-bus SDN confirm the potential of CVEs to enhance the network's operation and access significant profits for power sources, storage devices, and responsive load. Finally, the design achieved 100% flexibility for the SDN through proper management of CVEs, resulting in an improvement of operating indices between 15-97% compared to power flow studies. Moreover, the CVEs profit in the modeling of uncertainties reduces approximately 19.6% compared to the deterministic model of the proposed scheme under complete flexibility conditions. © 2013 IEEE.},

Due to the integration of operational technology (OT) and information communication technology (ICT), CI systems are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In addition, power systems, in particular, are an attractive target for attackers, as they are responsible for the operation of modern infrastructures and are thus of great importance for modern warfare or even for strategic purposes of other criminal activities. Virtual power plants (VPPs) are a new implementation of power plants for energy management. The protection of virtual power plants against APTs is not yet sufficiently researched. This circumstance raises the research question - What might an APT detection system architecture for VPPs look like? Our methodology is based on intensive literature research to bundle knowledge from different sub-areas to solve a superordinate problem. After the literature review and domain analysis, a synthesis of new knowledge is provided in the presentation of a possible architecture. The in-depth proposal for a potential system architecture relies on the study of VPPs, APTs, and previous prevention mechanisms. The architecture is then evaluated for its effectiveness based on the challenges identified. The proposed architecture combines concepts such as defense-in-depth and breath with situation awareness, and the observe, orient, decide, and act loop. Furthermore, a combination of traditional detection methods with graph analysis in the architecture is targeted to meet the challenges and peculiarities of VPPs and APTs.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper compares risk-averse optimization methods to address the self-scheduling and market involvement of a virtual power plant (VPP). The decision-making problem of the VPP involves uncertainty in the wind speed and electricity price forecast. We focus on two methods: risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming (SP) and two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO). We investigate both methods concerning formulations, uncertainty and risk, decomposition algorithms, and their computational performance. To quantify the risk in SP, we use the conditional value at risk (CVaR) because it can resemble a worst-case measure, which naturally links to ARO. We use two efficient implementations of the decomposition algorithms for SP and ARO; we assess (1) the operational results regarding first-stage decision variables, estimate of expected profit, and estimate of the CVaR of the profit and (2) their performance taking into consideration different sample sizes and risk management parameters. The results show that similar first-stage solutions are obtained depending on the risk parameterizations used in each formulation. Computationally, we identified three cases: (1) SP with a sample of 500 elements is competitive with ARO; (2) SP performance degrades comparing to the first case and ARO fails to converge in four out of five risk parameters; (3) SP fails to converge, whereas ARO converges in three out of five risk parameters. Overall, these performance cases depend on the combined effect of deterministic and uncertain data and risk parameters. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS},

	abstract = {Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) and Multi-Energy Systems (MESs) are aggregated energy systems comprising renewable energy sources, energy storage systems and dispatchable units. The presence of such diverse systems unlocks the possibility of a near-zero carbon emission energy generation while overtaking the main drawback of renewables sources that is their lack of control. Among the different energy storage systems, large scale (seasonal) H2 storages (e.g. salt cavern or depleted oil field) would allow shifting the excess solar energy from the hot to the cold season. High round-trip efficiency (electricity to electricity) and unpaired operational flexibility could be achieved using H2 in state-of-the-art combined cycles. This work investigates the optimal design and operation of a fully renewable VPPs integrating PV panels, batteries for short-term storage, electrolyzers, H2 seasonal storage and H2-fired combined cycles. The optimal design and optimal yearly operation of such complex VPP are formulated as Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) and solved to global optimality imposing to meet the highest possible fraction of the electricity demand profile. Results indicate that the optimal VPP design features a 490 MWhel of battery, 687 MWel of PV panels, 392 MWel of electrolyzer and requires a minimum H2 storage size of 168 GWhH2,LHV to power a combined cycle of 58 MWel. In case of a geological H2 seasonal storage availability, the resulting cost of generated electricity is above 430 $/MWhel, considerably higher with respect to the average electricity prices in Italy (in the range 50-80 $/MWhel) underlining the need of achieving better power-to-gas efficiencies and lower specific investment costs of conversion technologies in the next years. Furthermore, if the H2 storage needs to be built on purpose, the resulting cost of electricity would be even higher. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {With Demand Response (DR) and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) assets' increasing presence at the distribution level, distribution utilities are faced with increasing challenges - ranging from power flow reversals, voltage fluctuations, and phase imbalances, among others. To efficiently manage the impact of these new assets, collectively referred to as Grid-Edge Resources, it is worth examining what underlying grid architecture, systems or solutions would be required. Currently, most distribution grid operators rely on Distribution Management Systems (DMS) and Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) to gain visibility and the capability to control the grid and grid-connected assets. Now the question arises, should the current grid architecture be maintained and can the technology for DMS/ADMS simply be upgraded and extended to include tools and applications to manage DERs? Or, would a new technology stack involving separate Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), interfaced with the existing DMS/ADMS, provide the required visibility and control capability to manage the entire grid down to customer-side of the meter and all DERs, while providing DER owners and operators the ability to manage their assets based on incentive signals provided by DERMS? Several factors impact the decision on how to move forward on future grid management architecture. These factors include the fact that most DERs are owned by customers, are located in grid segments beyond DMS/ADMS reach, and may have local Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) and contractual requirements. Another factor is the distribution utilities' traditional separation between Customer Services, where all customer-related data are managed and maintained, and Distribution Operations, where all distribution grid data required for grid operations are managed. Other considerations are the tariff-related rules and requirements for DER participation, and the various capacity, energy and other service provisions required to support grid operations. Complicating the decision is the fact that these tariff rules and requirements are regional, utility-specific, and vary from utility to utility.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Today, consumer battery installations are isolated, physical devices. Virtual power plants (VPPs) allow consumer devices to aggregate for grid services, but they are are vertically integrated, vendor controlled systems (e.g., Tesla's VPP). Consumer batteries are therefore unable to participate in energy markets or other grid services outside what their vendor provides. We describe a software system that provides software control of multiple, networked battery energy storage systems in the electric grid. The system introduces two new ideas that enable flexible and dependable management of energy storage. The first is a virtual battery, which can either partition a battery or aggregate multiple batteries. The second is a reservation-based API which allows asynchronous control of batteries to meet contractual guarantees in a safe and dependable manner. Virtual batteries and a reservation-based API address the unique challenges of achieving high and efficient utilization of energy storage systems, including heterogeneity of battery systems such as varying C-rates, participation in energy markets, utility bill management systems, community resource sharing, and reliability. Using a testbed comprised of sonnen Inc. storage units installed in several homes and a lab, we demonstrate that virtualized batteries can seamlessly replace physical batteries, flexibly manage energy storage resources, isolate multiple clients using a shared battery, and create new energy storage applications.  © 2022 Owner/Author.},

A VPP aggregates distributed energy resource and can operate as a conventional power plant. In recent years, a large portion of renewable energy sources are installed in the commercial/industrial/residential building side, and their potentials and flexibilities can be aggregated in the VPP context. Nevertheless, building-side energy resources are usually managed by building energy management systems (BEMSs) with autonomous objectives and policies, making them hardly to be directly controlled by the VPP energy management system as the state-of-the-art VPP. This study systematically presents a building VPP (BVPP) architecture that aggregates building-side energy resources through the communication between the VPP energy management system and autonomous BEMSs. The implementation technologies, key components, and operation modes of BVPPs are discussed. Case studies are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of BVPP in different operational conditions. © 2021 The Authors.

This article develops a data-driven approach for VPP resource planning (VRP), in which BES sizing and DR customer selection are optimized synergistically to maximize VPP's profit in the electricity market. Heterogeneity in DR potential across individual customers is considered in the planning framework by utilizing the knowledge learnt from smart meter data. The overall VRP problem is formulated by a risk-managed, multistage stochastic programming framework to address the uncertainties from the intermittent renewable energy sources, load demands, market prices, and DR resources. Case studies compare the VRP results under two market imbalance settlement settings, namely, penalty-charged and penalty-free markets. The results demonstrate that jointly optimizing BES and DR customer selection leveraging the smart meter data can improve the VPP's expected profit under both market settings.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

The development of near real-time metering systems and home energy management technologies provide new possibilities for residential demand-side control. Due to the increase in energy prices and government schemes for improving residential energy efficiency and flexibility, domestic consumers are more aware and willing to participate in balancing services. The aggregator business model is previously proven to be successful for commercial-scale markets, due to the adequate amount of flexibility during peak hours and the corresponding financial incentives. Similarly, the domestic aggregation market is expected to grow and there has been a few feasibility studies that demonstrate the benefits to the grid and economy. However, there is a need for a further in-depth study of the cost-effectiveness of residential aggregation to provide virtual power plant (VPP) actions to encourage the development of residential demand response (DR).

Despite its significance, VPP currently has a very limited presence in the energy markets. A lack of systematic assessment of the multiple factors has been identified as the main reason for VPP's limited admittance into the energy markets. This necessitates research initiatives that consider superior approaches and frameworks for the sustainable future of VPPs. A novel multi-aspect framework (MAF) is proposed in this study to examine objectively multi-dimensional aspects. A STEEP (social, technological, environmental, economic, and political) analysis tool is used to assess the challenges, opportunities, and benefits of VPP in the energy market. The approach outlines the essential factors and actions needed to address the challenges of VPP admittance in the energy markets. This study demonstrated that there is still more work to be done to support the fast and wide-scale adoption of sustainable VPP applications. For this reason, a more favourable policy and regulatory framework based on social, technological, economic, environmental, and policy considerations are necessary to realize the genuine contributions of a VPP.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The simulation was performed at the premise of the characteristics of the western operational area's (WOA) existing electrical system and the cost associated with the PV system. The results revealed a high contribution of the VPP's PV generation to meeting the regional VPP demand under international fuel prices regime, which indicates an economic feasibility of building a PV system to meet a residential VPP.  © 2022 IEEE.},

However, the ES is not characterized and traded as an independent product in current market mechanisms. In this letter, the marginal utility of an ES is assessed and leveraged to characterize the effective ES, while a novel market scheme is proposed considering the trading of both ES and energy level (EL). The proposed scheme can well integrate ES producers such as virtual power plants that cannot be rewarded sufficiently to actively participate in the current market because they are principally labeled as EL consumers. Finally, the novel concept and mechanism are illustrated by a numerical study and verified to outperform the existing price schemes on integrating the ES resources and VRE. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.},

Against this backdrop, this paper explores multi-period dynamic export tariffs based on the dual variables of the optimisation problem used for aggregation. In contrast to the existing approaches, we use a multi-period optimisation model to account for inter-temporal coupling introduced by battery storage systems. We focus on three different VPP models with different objective functions, reflecting varying levels of customer focus.

The upper-level formulation of the problem minimizes a normalized objective function (a dimensionless function), which is a normalized summation of the expected annual energy cost and expected annual energy loss of the ADN, subjects to linearized AC optimal power flow (LAC-OPF) equations. Also, the lower-level problem minimizes the annual investment and expected operating costs of flexible and renewable sources constrained to the planning and operation model of these sources in the FRVPP framework. The suggested scheme incorporates the unscented transformation (UT) method to model the uncertainties of load, energy price, and renewable power generation. Then, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) approach converts the proposed bi-level problem into a single-level optimization formulation to achieve the optimal solution using conventional mathematical solvers. Finally, the proposed scheme is applied to a standard test system.

	abstract = {In recent years, the penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) has increased significantly due to their tremendous effect on network flexibility, economic indicators, and power loss. On the contrary, a diverse assortment of DERs can lead to some challenges in controlling these resources in the power grid. To acquire the maximum benefit of DERs and overcome their challenges the concept of virtual power plants (VPPs) has been suggested. Due to the ability of VPPs to participate in electricity markets and the competition of VPPs to gain more profit we are facing deregulated multi-operator markets, and it is necessary to define VPPs as price maker units. The optimal economic assessment of VPPs in a multi-operator market depends on two folds: modeling inner cooperation between its components and managing external competition with other VPPs. To this end, in this paper, a new framework for optimal economic assessment of a multi-operator VPP system is proposed by considering a combination of non-cooperative and cooperative game theory-based approaches. In the proposed methodology, VPPs compete with other rivals to determine the amount of power exchange and offer prices based on supply function equilibrium. Due to incomplete information of VPPs about other opponents and market construction, a combination of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm is proposed to find the Nash equilibrium point. Also, the Shapely value concept is used for fair distribution of shared profit among VPPs components. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified in two case studies for a multi-operator VPP with a diverse assortment of DERs. The results show that VPP profit and electricity market prices directly relate to the diversity of resources in VPP. In this regard, the mark-up coefficient of the VPP with a greater number of DERs is about 16% and 32% larger than the two other VPPs which leads to more profit for this VPP and resources in its coalition. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Demand Response (DR) mechanisms are an important pillar in the transition to a bigger share of renewable energy in the power grid. To utilize DR, industrial companies can offer load flexibility at DR markets by cooperating with DR aggregators. Numerous studies promote the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) in this domain, however there is a lack of actual implementations and real world adaption. The literature has identified several reasons for this. These include research that often focuses on a high level of abstraction, the assumption of homogeneous structures for the use of agents, and insufficient tools and solutions for industrial deployment. To help DR aggregators use MAS in their existing virtual power plants, this paper presents a MAS that enables a step-by-step switch to agent technology and enables them to implement the solutions developed by the research community to improve the management of their systems. The proposed technical implementation on standard industrial equipment and the required interfaces to flexibility provider and DR aggregator are derived from the German DR market requirements. A simulation of the MAS implemented on a laboratory setup via the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework will be presented. This should provide a foundation for the transition to real world adaption in the future, which will then be discussed to show the benefits and drawbacks of this solution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In particular, the optimal customer behavior in response to flexible electricity tariffs is analyzed.

This includes electrical energy generation, storage, demand, and access to the short-term electricity market.

With distributed renewable energy gradually replacing traditional power generation energy, virtual power plant (VPP) has become a hot technology concern for researchers in recent years. VPP integrates power generation, power consumption, and EV to achieve more efficient energy utilisation. As a distributed energy storage unit, EVs can present various forms of VPP in the local VPP network. The vehicle to grid (V2G) means bidirectional energy transmission mode from EV to the power grid. In the V2G operation mode, EVs can play an auxiliary role in shaving peak and fil valley to balance the supply and demand side and adjust the voltage (V) and frequency (f). The operation of the V2G system has many challenges at the level of battery aging and grid infrastructure.

	abstract = {Renewable energy systems have mushroomed in the form of microgrids and Virtual Power Plants (VPP). In Australia itself, there are over three million Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Integrating these new energy ecosystems into current systems is becoming a horrendous task as multi-dimensional energy flows and new energy business models are evolving. The stakeholders in the energy sector are focused on reducing costs prematurely while integration standards are still evolving, and interoperability of Internet of things (IoT) with legacy systems has outstanding security concerns. In this paper, the changing energy landscape is examined, and cybersecurity issues associated with the operation of VPPs and renewable energy-based microgrids are highlighted. The security and operational scenarios of new ecosystems are outlined, with an emphasis on DER interoperability, security, and integration. The design and development of these evolving standards into these new energy ecosystems is detailed based on observations from experiments on real-world DER installations.

In a shared energy storage system, prosumers could rent capacity and optimize its operation, whereas the operator also seeks to maximize the revenue of the BESS from both rental service and the virtual power plant (VPP) market. To optimize the pricing policy of the BESS, a novel pricing method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for this energy storage rental service. The interaction between the BESS operator and prosumers is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, which is further reformulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solved through the proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based DRL method. The case study shows that the proposed method could further increase the revenues of the BESS operator.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Realizing carbon neutral energy generation creates the challenge of accurately predicting time-series generation data for long-term capacity planning and for short-term operational decisions. The key challenges for adopting data-driven decision-making, specifically predictive analytics, can be attributed to data volume and velocity. Data volume poses challenges for data storage and retrieval. Data velocity poses challenges for processing the data near real time for operational decisions or for capacity building. This manuscript proposes a novel prediction method to tackle the above two challenges by using an event-based prediction in place of traditional time series prediction methods. The central concept is to extract meaningful information, denoted by events, from time-series data and use these events for predictive analysis. These extracted events retain the information required for predictive analytics while significantly reducing the volume of the velocity of data; consequently, a series of events present the information at a glance, effectively enabling data-driven decision-making. This method is applied to a data set consisting of six years of historical wind power capacity factor and temperature measurements. Deploying five deep learning models, a comparison is drawn between classical time-series predictions and series of events predictions based on computational time and several error metrics. The computational analysis results are presented in graphical format and a comparative discussion is drawn on the prediction results. The results indicate that the proposed method obtains the same or better prediction accuracy while significantly reducing computational time and data volume. © 2022 The Authors.

The trading behaviors of these VPPs needs to be carefully studied in order to maximize the benefits brought to the local energy market operator (LEMO) and each VPP. We propose a bounded rationality-based trading model of multi-VPPs in the local energy market by using a dynamic game approach with different trading targets. Three types of power bidding models for VPPs are first set up with different trading targets. In the dynamic game process, VPPs can also improve the degree of rationality and then find the most suitable target for different requirements by evolutionary learning after considering the opponents' bidding strategies and its own clustered resources. LEMO would decide the electricity buying/selling price in the LEM. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic game model is solved by a hybrid method consisting of an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm and conventional large-scale optimization. Finally, case studies are conducted to show the performance of the proposed model and solution approach, which may provide some insights for VPPs to participate in the LEM in real-world complex scenarios.  © 2015 CSEE.},

Within this framework, this study proposes a model that simulates the coordinated operation of an aggregate of power plants, including non-dispatchable DERs and, as regulating units, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation and electrochemical energy storage systems. A Monte Carlo procedure is adopted to realistically create a population of aggregation scenarios. The real-time operation of the DER portfolio is managed through a Heuristic Greedy-Indexing logic, which allows the Aggregator to select the optimal control action to implement according to the technical and economic quantities characterizing the market and the grid. The techno-economic performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulating its interaction with the electricity markets. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the profitability in different scenarios. The novel mathematical model proposed showed to be effective in managing a complex problem like the one at hand with an acceptable computational effort. The numerical results obtained confirmed that the aggregated participation in the market could provide interesting economic returns, especially if a CHP unit is involved as regulating unit, while the feasibility of the batteries adoption is still limited by the actual cost of the technology. © 2022 by the authors.

EV integration is widely done by introducing the virtual power plant (VPP) concept in which the EVs can be clustered and controlled together. By this way one single VPP or aggregator model can be used to solve the challenges in the grid such as power quality, systems losses, and peak demand management. This paper will first analyze the conventional single VPP model and its application. The research work will then propose a new strategy to overcome its limitation for flexible use of EVs by introducing a dynamic virtual power plant (DVPP) algorithm. This algorithm is able to cluster the EVs into different virtual power plants based on the EVs' present state of charge (SOC) and plug-out time. After the formation of different VPP clusters, the EV coordination and vehicle to grid (V2G) optimization of each VPP cluster are formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model while subjected to grid constraints. The proposed methodology is evaluated by MATLAB and Open-DSS simulation and the results indicate that the proposed approach has better grid performance than the conventional single fixed VPP model.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The developed methodology generates a pareto set of optimized planning solutions by means of an iterative procedure, which allows to systematically analyze and explore different prioritizations of the objectives as well as their dependencies and trade-offs, and therefore to identify an optimized planning solution for a concrete constellation of boundary conditions and objectives. A proposed planning solution covers both the technological design of the microgrids' virtual power plant (in terms of the composition and dimensioning of power plant types) and the energy storage system (in terms of the dimensioning of the storage units used in the microgrid). The energy storage system includes both stationary storages and mobile storages in electric vehicles, which are actively integrated into the energy storage system via a vehicle-to-grid approach. In the following, the degree of self-sufficiency of the microgrid, the total CO2 emissions and the mobility requirements of the electric vehicles integrated in the microgrids' energy storage system are considered as objectives.

The hypotheses of this research is that considering profit as an objective function would yield a more realistic and optimal sizes compared to Cost of Energy (COE) minimization approach adopted in literature. The analyzed VPP aggregates solar PV units, CCHP supplying power and thermal energy, Battery storage system and thermal energy storage system. The system is formulated in an optimization model fed by energy demand profile, prices and inputs for solar power (irradiance and weather data). The objective function is formulated based on maximization of profit of the VPP selling power to the grid by Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), selling power to consumers at the public electricity tariff, and selling thermal energy at an assumed constant tariff. CCHP non-linear part-load efficiency is also considered in the model, accordingly, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the optimization. Results of the optimally configured model achieved 36% improvement in COE compared to literature. Solar power contributed by 31% from the total produced energy without imbalance, grid power contributed by 4%, and CO2 emissions reduced by 47% compared to full dependency on the grid. Statistical relationships were drawn showing the relationship between profit, energy and exergy efficiencies versus different CCHP capacities. In addition, analysis is provided for the efficiencies’ relation with the dumped heat from the CCHP. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Modeling variable renewable energy generation is an essential step for effective VPP planning and operation. However, it is also a challenging task due to the uncertain nature of its sources. Therefore, developing tools to effectively predict these uncertainties is essential for the optimal participation of VPPs in the electricity market. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel method to model the uncertainties associated with energy dispatching in a VPP using the Unscented Transform (UT) method. The proposed algorithm minimizes the risks associated with the VPP operation in a computationally efficient and simple manner, and can be used in real-time on a power system. The proposed framework was evaluated based on an Electric Power System (EPS) model with historical data.

We propose a notion of predictability and fairness, which suggests that the long-term averages of prices or incentives offered should be independent of the initial states of the operators of the DER, the aggregator, and the power grid. We show that this notion cannot be guaranteed with many traditional controllers used by the load aggregator, including the usual proportional–integral (PI) controller. However, even considering the non-linearity of the alternating-current model, this notion of predictability and fairness can be guaranteed for incrementally input-to-state stable (iISS) controllers, under mild assumptions. © 2022 The Authors},

This study presents an interactive trading cooperation model of regionally interconnected VPPs using bilateral contracts. The proposed model maximizes overall electricity market social welfare (SW) (i.e., maximization of consumer benefits while minimizing energy costs). The focus of the proposed approach is to design and develop a parallel energy exchange cooperation model of interconnected VPPs, ensuring the operational efficiency and reliability of interconnected power systems over the planning horizon. Given that adjacent VPPs may have differences in their energy generation and usage patterns, a scenario tree method is used to model the uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and load demand. A case study of two interconnected VPPs is used, the operational scenario is designed, and the corresponding computational model is developed. The results highlight that the proposed approach gives VPPs the option to utilize their internal network’s maximum capacity. As a result, there will be less reliance on the main grid for interconnected VPPs, and an improvement in key performance indicators, including the cost of the VPPs systems and renewable power variations. © 2022 by the authors.},

A particular DER assumed to be widely available in the future is the distributed prosumer (DP), also called virtual power plant (VPP), which may host PV generation, and stationary and mobile battery energy storage systems, in addition to the on-site passive load. DP aggregation and participation in the day-ahead market ancillary service products (ASPs) require managing uncertainties associated with load consumption and photovoltaic generation, electric vehicle (EV) scheduling, market-clearance prices, etc. Outages in the distribution grid may distort these energy-limited resources from their optimal operating point, potentially impacting their ability to deliver the committed ASPs in real-time. To address these challenges, first, we develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of outages in distribution feeders. Next, we incorporate the distribution feeder State of Risk (SoR) predictions with the bidding model of the DP aggregator to provide an informed decision-making tool for optimal participation in the energy and ASP markets. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the proposed model in improving the aggregator profitability and preventing penalties for the inability to deliver ASPs due to unexpected energy capacity limits of DP assets. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The power systems of today seem inseparable from clean energy sources such as wind turbines (WTs) and photovoltaics (PVs). However, due to their uncertain nature, operational challenges are expected when WT and PV energy is added to the electricity network. It is necessary to introduce new technologies to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RESs). Therefore, rationally implementing a demand response (DR) program with energy storage systems (ESSs) in a virtual power plant (VPP) environment is recommended as a way forward to minimize the volatile nature of RESs and improve power system reliability. Our proposed approach aims to maximize social welfare (SW) (i.e., maximization of consumer benefits while minimizing energy costs). Our method assesses the impact of the DR program on SW maximization. Two scenarios are examined, one with and one without a DR program. Stochastic programming theory is used to address the optimization problem. The uncertain behavior of WTs, PVs, and load demand is modeled using a scenario-based approach. The correctness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a 16-bus UK generic distribution system. Our results show that SW and active power dispatch capacity of WT, PV, and ESS are fairly increased using the proposed approach. © 2022 by the authors.},

To manage in real-time the operation of the VPP, a new Rolling Horizon mixed-integer linear programming model is adopted. The effectiveness of the tools developed is proved by numerical simulations reproducing the different operating conditions of the VPP.

	abstract = {In recent years, the spot and ancillary service markets have become a relevant source of revenue for stationary battery storage systems. During this period, many markets have become increasingly flexible with shorter service periods and lower minimum power requirements. This flexibility makes the markets attractive for pools of electric vehicles (EVs), providing the opportunity to earn additional revenue. In this paper, multi-year measurement data from 22 commercial EVs are used to develop a simulation model to calculate the available power of an EV pool. In addition, the driving logbooks of >460 vehicles from commercial fleets of 14 different economic sectors are analyzed. Based on our simulations, we discuss the influence of shorter service periods on available pool power and power uncertainty. The key findings are that, especially at times with a high pool power, the uncertainty is low. This leads to the conclusion that commercial fleets offer a highly reliable power profile during known idle times depending on the economic sector. All investigated 14 sectors show high and reliable power availability at night and most show this availability also during weekends while others show a regular driving pattern seven days a week. These results are applicable to any energy market. To have a concrete use case, the impact of frequency containment reserve (FCR) flexibilization on the economics of an EV pool is analyzed using the German FCR market design from 2008 to 2022. It is shown that, depending on the fleet, especially the two recent changes in service periods from one week to one day and from one day to 4 h generate the largest increase in available pool power. Further future reductions in FCR service periods will only produce minor benefits, as idle times are often already longer than service periods. According to our analysis, revenues of about 450 €/a to 750 €/a could have been achieved per EV in the German FCR market between mid-2020 and the first quarter of 2022. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources (RESs) are increasingly used to meet the world’s growing electrical needs, especially for the economic benefits and environmental problems associated with fossil fuel use. Small-scale renewable energy sources, controllable loads, energy storage devices, and other nonrenewable sources are effectively integrated to form a virtual power plant (VPP). Uncertainty in forecasting renewable energy generation due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources is one of the biggest challenges in VPPs. Power generation by RESs changes with the day of the week, season, location, climate, and resource availability. Also, load demand and utility price vary with time and need to be forecasted for proper energy management of VPPs. However, the dispatching and planning of VPPs are significantly impacted by the volatile nature of RESs, load demand, and utility price. Predicting these uncertainties with high accuracy is essential to balance the electrical power generation and the load demand. In this article, a decision tree (DT) algorithm is proposed, to predict the uncertainty parameters, such as the day-ahead power from the RES, load demand, and utility prices of VPPs. The efficiency of the proposed model and the predicted results are compared with other complex models, such as the artificial neural network (ANN) and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms. Root-mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R 2), and mean absolute error (MAE) are the statistical metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction. One-year meteorological data of the Chennai zone in India is considered for predicting the uncertainty parameters. IEEE 16-bus and 33-bus test systems are used to validate the forecasting model. It is evident from the results that the proposed DT algorithm can predict the uncertainty parameters more accurately and use lesser time than the ANN and ARIMA algorithms. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Therefore, according to the EU's Electricity Balancing Guideline from 2017, Demand Response is to be integrated non-discriminatorily into the joint European mechanism for procurement of system services, which is currently being developed. In Germany, the procurement of system services was last adjusted in 2020, so that flexibility options available at short notice can participate recently. This offers a new marketing option for industrial flexibility options. Expected revenues in this balancing energy market are higher than in the continuous intraday market. Nevertheless, the introduction of the balancing energy market has not fulfilled its objective of increasing competition and the costs for balancing energy are immense. However, complex analyses are necessary for optimised marketing in the balancing energy market, compared to the intraday market, where the attractiveness of flexibility marketing is also increasing. In this paper, it is shown, that the prequalification mechanism for participation in the german energy balancing markets is currently too high, a hurdle for industrial demand response. Within the framework of European procurement, it must be possible to intensively integrate modern virtual power plants. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of many production units with small capacities and transforming them into a larger entity will make them visible in electricity market. Renewable based virtual power plant (VPP) in this paper is a wide energy management system that incorporates probabilistic wind and solar units, non-renewable Distributed Generation (DG) units, and dispatchable loads. In an electricity market, a VPP optimizes its operating schedules in order to increase its economic efficiency. However, market uncertainties may influence the VPP's profit. In this paper, modelling the uncertainties is implemented by the proposed Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT). The mentioned scheduling problem is formulated in three operation modes: risk-neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeker. The risk-neutral mode focuses on optimizing the VPP in the day-ahead market. In the risk-averse mode, the robustness function is used under low market prices. Moreover, in the risk seeker mode, an opportunity function is used under higher market prices towards higher profit results. The proposed model allows the VPP to decide on the scheduling of its components and the optimal bids to the day-ahead market. Another purpose is to investigate the role of the renewable-based VPP in minimizing emission and maximizing profit in a two-objective way. The IEEE 18-bus test system is utilized to simulate the proposed problem and analyse the results. The performance of the proposed problem is approved using different scenarios. Simulation results justify the advantages and necessities of the proposed problem. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Clean Energy for all Europeans policy package has opened the way for a major transition of the European energy landscape towards customer empowerment and local energy markets development. The European Green Deal, the Fit for 55 % package and the European Directives revision are pushing forward Renewable Energy Communities, which will disrupt the energy sector and overcome limitations of existing rigid energy markets. The rise of distributed energy technologies is fostering the development of customer-centered services such as peer-to-peer energy trading. However, adequate tools and business models to interface and engage with energy markets are still lacking. The H2020 FleXunity project is addressing the emerging market needs by developing a technological platform, that combines advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, blockchain technology and demand response services, to exploit new business models that could value the aggregation of small-scale energy assets. Although the concept of these platforms is relatively well known, their real-world implementation and validation is still at an early stage. This paper presents the FleXunity project's main objectives, details of the Virtual Power Plant managing Platform under development and the characteristics of two distinct real world pilot Energy Communities already deployed in the UK and Iberia. It also presents an analysis of the role that Demand Response activities and independent aggregation could play in Energy Communities, and specifically explores the role of Demand Response in the balancing markets of Finland, UK, Spain, and Portugal. Focusing on the pilot markets, the project also identifies the most promising balancing services to be provided by Energy Communities, by surveying and framing the existing regulatory qualification requirements. © 2022 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

In this survey paper, we review the different existing and emerging feedback control mechanisms and architectures used for the real-time operation of VPPs. In contrast to other works that have mostly focused on the optimal dispatch and economical aspects of VPPs in the hourly and daily time scales, in this paper we focus on the dynamic nature of the system during the faster sub-hourly time scales. The virtual (i.e., software-based) component of a VPP, combined with the power plant (i.e., physics-based) components of the power grid, make VPPs prominent examples of cyber-physical systems, where both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics play critical roles in the stability and transient properties of the system. We elaborate on this interpretation of VPPs as hybrid dynamical systems, and we further discuss open research problems and potential research directions in feedback control systems that could contribute to the safe development and deployment of autonomous VPPs. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of an optimized schedule procedure in enhancing the Economic Profitability (EP) of a tri-generation energy facility located in the Northern Italy and connected to a local District Heating and Cooling (DHC) network. The FICOTM Xpress Software has been utilized to optimize the thermal and electrical scheduling of the Combined Heating Cooling Power Plant (CHCPP)–DHC system by making use of both the effective exercise parameters of the CHCPP machines and a series of heating/cooling data loads delivered to the grid and appropriately selected from those considered representative of each season. The complex evolution of the traditional energy market has suggested to improve the optimization procedure by including the constrains resulting from the subscription of a Virtual Power Plant Management (VPPM) agreement. As main purpose, this work analyses and compares the impact that the implementation of both the adopted optimization procedure and the subscription of the VPPM contract can have in enhancing the EP index of the investigated energy facility. The outcomes of this analysis evidence that the acceptance of the VPPM can entail a positive impact of the entire EP index of the facility. This happens at the condition that the machines are rescheduled at the exercise conditions resulting from the simultaneous implementation of an optimization procedure. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of the optimization procedures in enhancing the global energy efficiency of complex energy systems. Furthermore, it demonstrates the role that innovative management solutions, as those represented by the emerging VPPM opportunities, could have in making the existing energy plants active players in the future Distributed Energy Generation (DEG) scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Besides the integration of renewable energies, electric vehicles pose an additional challenge to modern power grids. However, electric vehicles can also be a flexibility source and contribute to the power system stability. Today, the power system still heavily relies on conventional technologies to stay stable. In order to operate a future power system based on renewable energies only, we need to understand the flexibility potential of assets such as electric vehicles and become able to use their flexibility. In this paper, we analyzed how vast amounts of coordinated charging processes can be used to provide frequency containment reserve power, one of the most important ancillary services for system stability. Therefore, we used an extensive simulation model of a virtual power plant of millions of electric vehicles. The model considers not only technical components but also the stochastic behavior of electric vehicle drivers based on real data. Our results show that, in 2030, electric vehicles have the potential to serve the whole frequency containment reserve power market in Germany. We differentiate between using unidirectional and bidirectional chargers. Bidirectional chargers have a larger potential but also result in unwanted battery degradation. Unidirectional chargers are more constrained in terms of flexibility, but do not lead to additional battery degradation. We conclude that using a mix of both can combine the advantages of both worlds. Thereby, average private cars can provide the service without any notable additional battery degradation and achieve yearly earnings between EUR 200 and EUR 500, depending on the volatile market prices. Commercial vehicles have an even higher potential, as the results increase with vehicle utilization and consumption. © 2022 by the authors.},

However, the instability and unpredictability of such sources predominantly affect their plant production. Thus, utility-scale energy storage is required to aid in balancing supply and demand and, as a result, to prevent unbalances that might cause issues at different grid levels. In the present study, the authors’ patented energy storage technology, known as Integrated Energy Storage System (I-ESS), is combined with a 10 MWp solar plant. The PV plant and the I-ESS unit function as a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). The selected VPP management strategy attempts to optimize the daily hours during which the plant supplies steady power output. Numerical simulations show that the VPP plant can effectively smooth the PV peak and manage the power supply. In particular, by the definition of a novel metric expressing the ratio between regular hours of power provided to the grid plus the energy stored in the backup unit and the total number of hours in a year, the results show that the VPP regularity is relatively high in terms of PV output, ranging from a low of 50% in December to a high of 87% in August. Thus, the proposed VPP arrangement seems to be a promising technology for pushing toward the carbon-neutral transition. © 2022 by the authors.},

To this end, a hybrid feedback-based optimization algorithm along with deep learning forecasting technique is proposed to specifically address the cyber-related issues. The online decentralized feedback-based DER optimization control requires timely, accurate voltage measurement from the grid. However, in practice such information may not be received by the control center or even be corrupted. Therefore, the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm is employed to forecast delayed/missed/attacked messages with high accuracy. The IEEE 37-node feeder with high penetration of PV systems is used to validate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid algorithm. The results show that 1) the LSTM-forecasted lost voltage can effectively improve the performance of the DER control algorithm in the practical cyber-physical architecture; and 2) the LSTM forecasting strategy outperforms other strategies of using previous message and skipping dual parameter update.  © 2023 IEEE.},

For the application in the energy domain it is demonstrated that state-of-the-art RL algorithms can be trained to control potentially millions of small-scale assets in private households. In detail, the applied RL algorithm outperforms common heuristic algorithms and only falls slightly short of the results provided by linear optimization, but at less than a thousandth of the simulation time.

The future power system with a high proportion of renewable and sustainable energy is required to have large-scale, low-cost, flexible, and adjustable resources. To this end, this article aggregates user-side distributed energy storage and electric vehicles into a virtual power plant, considering the uncertainty of wind power fluctuations and the uncertainty of electric vehicle charging and discharging to establish a day-ahead and intra-day peak regulation model for combined peak regulation of virtual and thermal power plants. The bounding algorithm seeks the optimal strategy for the two-stage model of joint peak regulation and obtains the day-ahead and intra-day two-stage optimal peak regulation strategy. The simulation example shows that the virtual power plant and its day-ahead and intra-day optimal peak regulation strategy can reduce the peak regulation cost of the power system, as compared with the deep peak regulation of thermal power plants with a special supporting energy storage power station. This work provides a global perspective for virtual power plants to participate in the formulation of power system peak regulation rules.

	abstract = {The rapid development of Internet-of-Things in smart grid has enabled millions of grid-connected distributed controllable resources (DCR; e.g., electric vehicles, controllable loads) to provide service to the grid, such as frequency regulation and demand response. The integration of these DCRs may become a large virtual power plant network with various characteristics. This poses great challenges from both control and management perspectives, e.g., computation/communication burden, optimization complexity, scalability limitation, prosumer privacy, etc. In this article, we propose an effective autonomous incentive-based DCR control and management framework to integrate a large amount of DCRs to provide grid services, which simultaneously provides accurate active power adjustment to the grid, optimizes DCR allocations, and maximizes the profits for all prosumers and system operators. A model-free deep deterministic policy gradient-based method is designed to find the optimal incentives in a continuous action space to encourage prosumers to adjust their power consumptions. The method is implemented in a consortium open-source blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, which facilitates controls and transaction management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, extensive experimental studies are conducted using real-world data. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the transition to a two-sided electricity market, energy users are turning into prosumers who own the flexible distributed energy resources (DERs) and have the potential to provide services to the power system. Virtual power plants (VPPs) aggregate DERs to join the electricity market and respond to system signals. It is urgent to develop a new pricing mechanism for VPPs to allocate the payoff from the electricity market to prosumers. This paper proposes a customized rebate package pricing mechanism for a VPP retailer to reward prosumers for supporting the power system. The retailer's pricing strategies are determined based on a Stackelberg game, considering the heterogeneous prosumers' dynamic selecting process based on an evolutionary game. The extended replicator dynamics is proposed to take the future payoff into account and guarantee the evolutionary equilibrium. Moreover, a new reinforcement learning algorithm based on the Cross learning model is developed to solve the evolutionary game with less computational effort. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed customized rebate package pricing mechanism, which can efficiently reward prosumers' flexible resources in supporting the system while maximizing the retailer's utility to achieve a win-win outcome.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

To provide a stimulating environment, a semester-long project is designed (as a part of an introductory Thermodynamics course) that requires students to design a virtual power plant. The project includes a range of tasks that provide students an opportunity to understand various aspects involved in construction of a power plant such as: choosing a geographic location for the power plant based on energy demands, examining economic and social impacts involved in construction of a power plant, and performing design calculations on individual components of the power plant. To aid students' understanding of the abstract engineering concepts involved in this project, a virtual objects (vObjects) tool is developed that includes animations, videos, and power, efficiency and design calculators. This article explains the tool development process (code and rationale), testing of the tool, tool refinement, and analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool. The vObjects tool is developed using the LabVIEW software from National Instruments. Based on the analysis, the tool is found to improve the conceptual understanding of the topics in the course. The overall objective of this work is to understand the effectiveness of virtual learning environments. Results from the usability study suggest vObjects tool is user friendly and intuitive to use by undergraduate engineering students. Further, this tool can be used or modified for pedagogy of various science or engineering courses from K-12 to college where the use of physical objects is limited. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, a robust optimisation method (ROM) is proposed with aim to achieve optimal scheduling of virtual power plants (VPPs) in the day-ahead electricity markets where electricity prices are highly uncertain. Our VPP is a collection of various distributed energy resources (DERs), flexible loads, and energy storage systems that are coordinated and operated as a single entity. In this study, an offer and bid-based energy trading mechanism is proposed where participating members in the VPP setting can sell or buy to/from the day-ahead electricity market to maximise social welfare (SW). SW is defined as the maximisation of end-users benefits and minimisation of energy costs. The optimisation problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear programming model taking the informed decisions at various levels of uncertainty of the market prices. The benefits of the proposed approach are consistency in solution accuracy and traceability due to less computational burden and this would be beneficial for the VPP operators. The robustness of the proposed mathematical model and method is confirmed in a case study approach using a distribution system with 18-buses. Simulation results illustrate that in the highest robustness scenario, profit is reduced marginally, however, the VPP showed robustness towards the day-ahead market (DAM) price uncertainty. © 2022.

	abstract = {The penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the electrical power system has increased significantly over the past years due to increasing global concern about climate change. However, integrating RESs into the power market is highly problematic. The output of RESs such as wind turbines (WTs) and photovoltaics (PVs) is highly uncertain. Their correlation with load demand is not always guaranteed, which compromises system reliability. Distributed energy resources (DERs), especially demand response (DR) programs and energy storage systems (ESSs), are possible options to overcome these operational challenges under the virtual power plant (VPP) setting. This study investigates the impact of using a DR program and battery energy storage system (BESS) on the VPP’s internal electricity market, and also cost-minimization analysis from a utility viewpoint. Three different constrained optimal power flow (OPF) problems are solved such as base case, DR case, and BESS case to determine total incurred costs, locational marginal prices (LMPs), and generator commitments. A scenario tree approach is used to model the uncertainties associated with WTs, PVs, and load demand. The proposed model is investigated on a 14-bus distribution system. The simulation results obtained demonstrate a favorable impact of DR and a BESS on renewable operational challenges. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Distributed energy resources (DER) can be efficiently aggregated by aggregators to sell excessive electricity to spot market in the form of Virtual Power Plant (VPP). The aggregator schedules DER within VPP to participate in day-ahead market for maximizing its profits while keeping the static operating envelope provided by distribution system operator (DSO) in real-time operation. Aggregator, however, needs to make a decision of its offer for biding under the uncertainties of market price and wind power. This paper proposes a two-stage data-driven scheduling model of VPP in day-ahead (DA) and real time (RT) market. In DA market, in order to determine VPP output for biding, a piece-wise affine formulation of VPP profits combing with CVaR for avoiding market price risk is constructed firstly, and then a data-driven distributionally robust model using a Wasserstein ambiguity set is constructed under uncertainties of market price and wind forecast errors. A set of data-driven linearization power constraints are applied in both DA and RT operation when the parameters of distribution network are unknown or inexact. The model then is reformulated equivalently to a mixed 0–1 convex programming problem. The proposed scheduling model is tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network showing that under same 1000-sample dataset in training, proposed DRO model has over 85% of reliability while the stochastic optimization has only 69% under the market risk, which means the proposed model has a better out-of-sample performance for uncertainties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The large penetration in the energy mix of renewable-based plants like wind and solar is considered a key aspect to boost the transition toward a decarbonised and sustainable energy system and, subsequently, to tackle the settled climate targets. However, the variability and unpredictability of solar and wind plants production requires the implementation of actions able to assist the matching of supply and demand and in turn to avoid unbalances able to generate issues at various grid levels. Among them, the installation of utility-scale energy storage systems is of crucial importance to split the energy production from its consumption, compensate the power fluctuations and provide a more regular and predictable power profile. In this context, Thermal Energy Storage System for electricity applications is receiving considerable interest among researchers due to its expected reliability. In the past, the Authors developed the so-called Integrated Energy Storage System (I-ESS) and, in the present investigation, they propose its coupling with a 10 MWp PV facility. In this way, the PV plant and the I-ESS facility act as a Virtual Power Plant to make the power profile more regular. The Virtual Power Plant is modelled in Matlab environment and the numerical simulations show that the regularity of the power supply, defined by a dedicated index, is very high concerning the PV production and ranges from 50% (winter time) to 87% (summer period). © Proceedings of ECOS 2022 - 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.},

	abstract = {The paradigm shift of power markets towards the smart grid, involves mass energy transfer between entities and requires the support of effective policies under comprehensive framework. This paper presents a technical-economic framework for energy wheeling (FEW) that encompass a self-sufficient smart energy network of regional microgrids and virtual power plants. The generation capacity design of regional microgrids (MGs) is in accordance with the forecasted load of the regional population, whilst MG's excess energy is made available for wheeling. The Facebook Prophet forecasting model is used to forecast the load in accordance to regional population growth for twenty years. Each virtual power plant (VPP) is the coalition of wind and solar resources based regional MGs. The underlying network of regional VPPs supports the wheeling framework by communicating with each other through a trading platform that follows an energy distribution model (EDM), based on intelligent publisher–subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern. The results of this framework are implemented on a developing country i.e. Pakistan. Through this framework, 39.9 MW solar and wind energy will be injectable in the country's power system, thus raising the renewables share from 4.6% to 4.7% of the total generation capacity. The achieved results are supported with economic analysis. © 2022 The Authors},

This paper presents work carried out in the SIES 2022 ERA-Net project, which is investigating in detail the possible provision of flexibility by different technologies, including EVs, but thorough a lens of different business models. Thus, presented work relies on the real use cases. The focus of this work is on the construction of grid representations to guide bidding in potential flexibility markets. It shows that without an appropriate level of detail on the wider grid connections, these bidding strategies, and therefore associated asset optimization schedules, could lead to errors. A methodology that derives EV price response curves is highlighted, with an aim to use such curves in sophisticated optimization scheduling module for further work in management of EV integration. © 2022 CIRED workshop on E-mobility and power distribution systems.

	abstract = {Australia has world leading uptake of distributed PV (D-PV) and increasing installations of battery energy storage systems (BESS). D-PV and BESS can provide various economic and environmental benefits to energy users, network companies and other industry stakeholders. However, integrating increasing levels of D-PV into electricity networks present a range of social, technical, and regulatory challenges such as voltage management in low voltage networks. To help distribution network service providers in managing network voltage effectively, it is increasingly required that inverter-based D-PV and BESS implement one or more of the following power quality response modes (PQRM): tripping (anti-islanding and limits for sustained operation), Volt-VAr (V-VAr) and Volt-Watt (V-Watt). The PQRMs can curtail power output which may limit opportunities and revenue that D-PV and BESS owners obtain from their investments. On the other hand, these modes can help with the management of voltage. Curtailment and Network Voltage Analysis Scoping Study (CANVAS) is a RACE for 2030 scoping study by the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets at UNSW, including industry partners AGL, SA Power Networks and Solar Analytics. The study analysed two datasets including 1000 BESS sites from AGL's Virtual Power Plant trial and 500 D-PV sites from Solar Analytics' customer database both within the metropolitan Adelaide, focusing on the first two PQRM modes: tripping (anti-islanding and limits for sustained operations) and V-VAr curtailment. The study found a range of V-VAr response behavior from BESS and D-PV likely to be due to different installation dates and legacy standard settings. The tripping and V-VAr curtailment were not significant for most energy users (less than 1% of total generation); however, some energy users lost up to 20% of their total generation. This clearly raises the issue of fairness in relation to curtailment which will become a more prevalent issue as D-PV penetration increases. © 2021 IEEE},

In addition, tracking errors from modeling a heterogeneous fleet of packetized DERs with a group of homogeneous macromodels are analytically derived for relevant PEM information scenarios.

CHP-VPP operation models with uncertainties are built based on the inherent behaviors of DERs operating in two coupled energy networks, i.e., the electricity and the heat networks. To balance the interests of multiple stakeholders in the coupled energy networks, a cooperative game scheduling model for CHP-VPP is established.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the impacts of joint operation of wind power producers (WPPs) with electric vehicles (EVs) and demand response (DR) resources as a virtual power plant (VPP) in electricity markets. In particular, this paper aims at answering the question of whether these resources have incentives to voluntarily form a VPP to participate in the electricity market. For this purposes, two stochastic multi-period game models of the day-ahead (DA) electricity market are proposed based on the oligopolistic competition theory. The first model considers when the WPP, EV aggregator (EVA), and DR aggregator (DRA) form a VPP and bid in the DA market in a cooperative way, and the Shapley value method is applied to allocate the VPP's profit among the WPP, EVA and DRA; while the second model focuses on when they bid in the DA market in a non-cooperative way. In both models, the scenario generation and reduction technique is employed to simulate wind speed uncertainties, and a deviation penalty mechanism is applied when the WPP's actual output deviate from its cleared quantity in the market. In addition, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to measure financial risks of the WPP and analyze its risk preference. Numerical examples show that the VPP mode can help the WPP to reduce its deviation between its actual output and cleared quantity and improve its competitiveness in the market. In addition, individual profits of the WPP, EVA and DRA will all increase in the VPP mode, which means that the WPP, EVA and DRA have high incentives to voluntarily form a VPP and participate in the electricity market. © 2021},

	abstract = {Grid frequency support is one of the most challenging issues in wind rich islanded power systems. This problem becomes critical with the displacement of synchronous generators and their associated services (i.e., inertia and primary operating reserve). The services that are lost can be replaced by other sources, such as demand response schemes to enhance the resiliency and security of power system operations. Demand response based on internet data centers is expected to become an increasingly important asset to make a significant contribution to frequency ancillary services. To exploit this resource, internet service companies are expected to combine the capabilities of a variety of data centers to participate as a single provider similar to a virtual power plant. In this context, this work develops a novel framework for cooperative participation of data centers delay-tolerant workloads and backup power supply units to provide effective fast frequency response service. This is achieved by employing the model predictive controller to initiate reference signals to data center resources while respecting device operating conditions and constraints. Various case studies are run on the modified linear model of the 39 Bus system via dynamic simulations for the projected 75 % system non-synchronous penetration. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of different data center configurations to stabilize grid frequency during signal delays and severe cascade failures. The analysis shows that the proposed framework is critical to the adoption of renewable energy and reduces the requirement for an expensive spinning reserve used in a typical power system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) poses a significant challenge for the power grid operator in terms of increasing peak load and power quality reduction. Moreover, there is a growing demand for fast charging services in smart grids. Addressing the growing demand from fast charging services is challenging. To overcome this challenge, in this article, we propose a new computational architecture combining energy trading and demand responses based on cloud computing for managing virtual power plants (VPPs) in smart grids. In the proposed system, EVs can be charged at high charging rates without affecting the operation of the power grid by purchasing energy through the energy trading platform in the cloud. In addition, users with storage devices can sell energy surplus to the market. On the one hand, the energy trading platform can be regarded as an internal market of the VPP that aims to maximize its revenue. The interest of the EV owners, on the other hand, is to minimize the cost for charging. Therefore, we model the interactions between the EV owners and the VPP as a non-cooperative game. To search for the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game, we design an algorithm and then analyze its computational complexity and communication overhead. We utilize real data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Our results illustrate that the users with only storage devices can obtain nearly 200\%200% higher revenue on average by participating in the proposed internal market. Moreover, users with only EVs can reduce their charging costs by nearly 50\%50% in average. Users with both EVs and storage devices can reduce the charging costs even further by approximately 120\%120% where the users get profit by utilizing the internal market.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Developing clean and renewable energies provides a good solution to mitigate the growing environmental and energy crises, however, electricity market structures have not yet embraced the evolution to include these decentralized, small-scale and uncertain renewable generation units. In this paper, peer-to-peer based virtual power plants are proposed for risk-averse energy trading of small-scale generations and consumers. Inside the virtual power plants, peer-to-peer platforms are introduced to coordinate the small-scale generators and consumers into virtual power plants. The uncertainty of the renewable-based generations is compensated by the energy diversities in virtual power plants, which further improves the energy utilization efficiency of the renewable-based generations. Physical electricity trading approach is adopted, which promotes local electricity consumption and reduces the power congestion risk. For energy trading among virtual power plants, financial trading approaches (e.g.day-ahead contracts) are provided. The diversified trading framework of the proposed mechanism facilitates the renewable energy's access to the electricity market despite their small-scale and non-dispatchable characteristics. Moreover, a two-stage stochastic game model is proposed for the day-ahead energy bidding strategies, in which Cournot Nash pricing mechanism is introduced to balance the supply and demand and the conditional value-at-risk is employed for overbidding risk management. A set of realistic case studies of the Australian energy market and their analysis allow us to show that such a peer-to-peer-based virtual power plant market structure can effectively reduce the overbidding risk while maximizing the renewable energy usage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Moreover, the shorter time intervals and greater collection of data can facilitate the integration of distributed renewable energy into the power grid. This study contributes to the understanding of time-varying pricing using a model that examines the extent to which transactive energy can reduce economic costs of an aggregated group of households with varying levels of distributed solar energy.

	abstract = {This paper presents a risk-averse stochastic framework for short-term scheduling of virtual power plants (VPPs) in a competitive environment considering the potential of activating electric vehicles (EVs) and smart buildings in demand response (DR) programs. In this framework, a number of EV Parking Lots (PLs) which are under the jurisdiction of the VPP and its rivals are considered that compete to attract EVs through competitive offering strategies. On the other hand, EVs' owners try to choose a cheaper PL for EVs' charging to reduce payment costs. Therefore, the objective of EVs owners can be in conflict with the objective of PLs that provide services for EVs under each VPP. In this regard, the decision-making problem from the VPP's viewpoint should be formulated as a bi-level optimization model, in which in the upper-level, the VPP profit should be maximized and in the lower-level, procurement costs of EVs and other responsive loads should be minimized, simultaneously. To solve the proposed bi-level problem, it is transformed into a traceable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem using duality theory and Karush-Kahn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The proposed model is tested on a practical system and several sensitivity analyses are carried out to confirm the capability of the proposed bi-level decision-making framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As the relative importance of renewable energy in electric power systems increases, the prediction of photovoltaic (PV) power generation has become a crucial technology, for improving stability in the operation of next-generation power systems, such as microgrid and virtual power plants (VPP). In order to improve the accuracy of PV power generation forecasting, a fair amount of research has been applied to weather forecast data (to a learning process). Despite these efforts, the problems of forecasting PV power generation remains challenging since existing methods show limited accuracy due to inappropriate cloud amount forecast data, which are strongly correlated with PV power generation. To address this problem, we propose a PV power forecasting model, including a cloud amount forecasting network trained with satellite images. In addition, our proposed model adopts convolutional self-attention to effectively capture historical features, and thus acquire helpful information from weather forecasts. To show the efficacy of the proposed cloud amount forecast network, we conduct extensive experiments on PV power generation forecasting with and without the cloud amount forecast network. The experimental results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of our proposed prediction model, combined with the cloud amount forecast network, are reduced by 22.5% compared to the model without the cloud amount forecast network. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {To adequately utilize flexible resources on demand side, Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is an effective solution through the aggregation and application of distributed energy resources (DER). While centralized control approaches are easy to achieve global optimum for the scheduling of every DER, they have limitations when dealing with massive number of complex and heterogeneous DERs with time-varying states. Existing decentralized control approaches are mainly based on the assumption that all DERs are completely rational, which is quite far from the reality. In this paper, using a bottom-up approach, we propose a stimulus–response control strategy to realize exploitation of flexibility by VPP. In such a strategy, DERs are dynamically aggregated through autonomous decentralized system, and interact with each other via subscription and publication of topics, regardless of the source and recipient of the messages, thus removing the direct coupling relationship between VPP Operator and DERs. Furthermore, each DER makes an independent decision through edge computing at an agent that has a general End-to-End structure and is driven by the stimulus message received from VPP Operator. We develop a simple yet efficient double deep q-network (DDQN) algorithm to optimize the state sequence of DER agents. A simulation study is conducted with over 1000 DERs including photovoltaics, electric vehicles and air conditioners. Results indicate that the proposed approach can dynamically aggregate DERs and exploit their flexibility with each DER agent dynamically adapting to the change of stimulus signals, thus achieving dynamic, automatic and adaptive exploitation of flexibility by VPP. © 2020},

DGs may be organized in virtual power plants (VPPs), where DGs’ schedules must be coordinated to enable the VPP to act as a single plant. One approach to solving this problem is using multi-agent systems (MAS) to offer autonomous, robust, and flexible control methods. The coordination of such systems requires communication between agents. The time required for this depends on communication characteristics, determined by the underlying communication infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate communication influences for the wireless technologies CDMA 450 and LTE Advanced on the fully distributed optimization heuristic COHDA, which is used to perform optimized scheduling for a VPP. The use case under consideration is the adaptation of schedules to provide flexibility for regional congestion management for delivery on a regionalized ancillary service market (rAS). We investigate the scalability of the VPP and the effects of disturbances in the communication infrastructure. The results show that the optimization duration of COHDA can be influenced by the underlying communication infrastructure and that this optimization method is applicable to a limited extent for product delivery of rASs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The structural mass of a building provides inherent thermal storage capability. Through sector coupling, the building mass can provide additional flexibility to the electric power system, using, for instance, combined heat and power plants or power-to-heat. In this work, a mathematical model of building inertia thermal energy storage (BITES) for integration into optimized smart grid control is introduced. It is shown how necessary model parameters can be obtained using generalized additive modeling (GAM) based on measurable building data. For this purpose, it is demonstrated that the ceiling surface temperature can serve as a proxy for the current state of energy. This allows for real-world implementation using only temperature sensors as additionally required hardware. Compared with linear modeling, GAM enable improved modeling of the nonlinear characteristics and interactions of external factors influencing the storage operation. Two case studies demonstrate the potential of using building storage as part of a virtual power plant (VPP) for optimized smart grid control. In the first case study, BITES is compared with conventionally used hot water tanks, revealing economic benefits for both the VPP and building operator. The second case study investigates the potential for savings in CO2 emission and grid connection capacity. It shows similar benefits when using BITES compared to using battery storage, without the need for hardware investment. Given the ubiquity of buildings and the recent advances in building control systems, BITES offers great potential as an additional source of flexibility to the low-carbon energy systems of the future.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Integrating decentralised energy sources into the traditional distribution networks can result in technical issues impacting the power quality. Innovative ideas are, therefore, needed to promote the transformation of systems to a smart grid. Distribution System operator (DSO) could make use of the flexibility of emerging technologies as a method to address these power quality issues. This study aims to present an overview of a local flexibility market (LFM) which will allow DSO requirements to be fulfilled through the (VPP) as an energy flexibility provider. The required optimization loads, generators and as well as storage units, are undertaken in the general algebraic modeling simulation (GAMS) environment. The aim of the optimization problem is to provide DSOs the opportunity to increase or curtail the local generations and loads in order to satisfy their requirement. The VPP will then be responsible for handling the relevant requests in real time to ensure the correct operating schedule of a resource is applied. The preliminary results of simulation studies presented in this paper have shown that the local market framework for flexibility could have potential for deferring investments in distribution network capacity, minimizing energy costs and improving the hosting capacity of distribution networks.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.},

When renewable energy sources (RESs) are available, they can be used to supply the energy demand of the PEVs.

Particularly, the concept for the use of LoRaWAN to remotely monitor and control the PEV charging loads is presented. Moreover, a hierarchical VPP control (VPPC) system based on the model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed for the optimal energy management (EM) of the VPP. The EM of the VPP is scheduled based on the predicted information initially and based on the optimal values for the EM and the intermittency of PV generation, the charging rate of the PEVs is modified during the real-time process. The results of the case studies show that the proposed VPPC can minimize the energy costs to the VPP and satisfy the energy balancing for the VPP entities while fulfilling the charging demand of the PEVs under system uncertainties. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Harnessing flexibility from distributed energy resources (DER) to participate in various markets while accounting for relevant technical and commercial constraints is essential for the development of low-carbon grids. However, there is no clear definition or even description of the salient features of aggregated DER flexibility, including its steady-state and dynamic features and how these are impacted by network constraints and market requirements. This paper proposes a comprehensive DER flexibility modelling and characterisation framework that is based on the concept of nodal operating envelope (NOE). In particular, capacity, ramp, duration and cost are identified as key flexibility metrics and associated with different but consistent NOEs describing capability, feasibility, ramp, duration, economic, technical and commercial flexibility features. These NOEs, which conceptually arise from a Venn diagram, can be built via optimal power flow (OPF) analysis, visualised in the active-reactive power space, and used by different stakeholders. Results from a canonical test system and a real distribution system illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed framework to model and characterise provision of flexibility and market services from DER for different use cases.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a decentralized economic dispatch method and an architecture suitable for the virtual power plant (VPP) aggregating massive distributed energy resources (DERs). The convergence condition is given for quadratic cost functions, and is extended to the case of general increasing function of incremental cost (IC). Further analysis shows that the step of this method is adaptive, which is generated from the bottom up according to the responsiveness of each DER unit (DERU). Combined with the decentralized architecture based on message queue (MQ), the algorithm design considers the hosting mechanism of the coordinator failure, which not only improves the efficiency of calculation and communication without losing privacy-protection, but also makes it more fault-tolerant. The correctness and effectiveness of the method are verified in the case studies. The iterative process can respond and converge quickly when DER units reach capacity limits or devices fail/join. Due to the adaptability of the step, the method has strong robustness to the quantity and parameters randomness of underlying units. Therefore, it can be applied to the VPP with a massive number of DERs in order to get consensus solution by rapid economic dispatch. © 2021},

	abstract = {With the evolution of wind turbine technologies, an immense desire is to integrate this energy into power markets more than ever. On the other hand, wind farms have a limited role in the electricity market due to their uncertainty. The influence of wind farms, electric vehicles, and flexible loads participating in the electricity markets aiming to minimize the deviation of wind power generation capacity from the final amount of cleared power in the market has been explored in this study. Two probabilistic models have been considered for this goal in a day-ahead electricity market. Wind farms, electric vehicles, and flexible loads offer competitive prices in the first scenario by forming a virtual power plant (VPP). In the second scenario, they engage individually in the electrical market. Both generation models incorporate a scenario reduction technique to simulate the uncertainty associated with wind turbine production capacity and a penalty mechanism for violating the wind farm generation from the amount of pledged capacity in the market. The results imply that wind farms, electric cars, and flexible loads benefit from engaging as a virtual power plant scheme component in the electricity market.  © 2022 IEEE.},

This stability boundary identification enables superior observability of the virtual power plant's cyber-layer to the network prosumers. Hence, allowing prosumers to perform independently stability studies at their local point of common coupling bus terminals. Thereby, providing a secure alternative to the information received from a compromised virtual power plant cyber-layer during cyber-attacks. The main concept of this article is solving a pair of simultaneous differential equations to deduce the grid voltage seen at the prosumer point of common coupling bus. These two differential equations are describing the relation between the active and reactive power measurements observed at the prosumer point of common coupling bus and the grid voltage. Then, this real-time grid voltage observation is utilized in constructing P-V curve or P-Q-V surface for identifying the stability boundary (i.e., the critical point of collapse) of the prosumer point of common coupling bus. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated with three scenarios. © 2021 IEEE.},

In contrast to forecast-based balancing at low risk, they need a strategy for operating distributed energy resources (DER) like an insurance scheme under high risk circumstances. In this paper, we develop such a strategy based on the prediction of the amount of uncertainty. We propose a risk filter for operating flexible DER to make them ready and keep them available for the expected unknown intraday balancing actions. This risk capability is achieved by imposing continuously varying flexibility corridor restrictions that are tuned by two risk sensitivity parameters. The effectiveness of our approach is shown by analyzing the trade-off between day-ahead cost and benefit gained from intraday imbalance reduction. Efficiency measures are developed to evaluate our solutions for operating e.g. power-to-heat interconnected with wind parks. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For coordinated operation of distributed energy resources, virtual power plants are introduced as a solution to maximize the net profit of all participants considering the uncertainties. In this study, a stochastic scheduling problem for a virtual power plant is modeled to meet the thermal and electrical load considering the network security constraints and uncertainties of electrical and thermal loads, wind speed, solar radiation, and market price. The virtual power plant consists of conventional generators, photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, photovoltaic-thermal panels, combined heat and power, energy storage systems, and boilers. To model all uncertain parameters, a scenario reduction approach is used to decrease the number of possible scenarios. Also, to increase the accuracy of the uncertainty modeling, a new approach for modeling the wind speed uncertainty is proposed. By utilizing a proper linear model for the conventional generators, the scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming. Two cases are introduced to study the effects of including photovoltaic-thermal panels in the scheduling problem using the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system. The problem is modeled in GAMS environment and is solved using CLPEX solver. The results show that the proposed model for virtual power plants scheduling for the next 24 h increases the expected net profit. Simulation results show that considering photovoltaic-thermal panels increases the expected net profit. Also, addition of photovoltaic-thermal panels has decreased the dependency of the virtual power plant on the boiler and combined heat and power for meeting the thermal load. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effects of electricity price on virtual power plant profit. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This methodology has so far been adapted to include risk assessment for guaranteeing system security i.e. non-functional requirements. Recent work on engineering use cases that require specific adaptivity processes to make the system resilient against unexpected, rare events indicated the necessity to refine the established methodologies. In this paper, we propose an extension to the established engineering methodology that guides development teams to quantify such functional risks during requirements engineering phase. This enables inferring the suitable operating principles and system architectures for appropriate adaptive application designs. For demonstration, we consider the risks that arise from operating a virtual power plant under rare environmental conditions that are usually treated by manual trading activities. The methodology is validated in a case study for risk-aware balancing of renewable energy via flexible prosumers thereby reproducing the ad-hoc workflow used for particular flexibility use cases in earlier work. Altogether, we show how, at design time, the use of the proposed methodology supports the development of risk-aware adaptive systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The VPP integrates multiple renewable energy hubs consisting of electric vehicle charging stations with photovoltaic and battery energy storage systems. The proposed model derives co-optimized strategic decisions for the VPP operator in the day-ahead (joint active power, reserve, and reactive power) markets while considering the balancing market operation. The proposed model is reformulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and the strong duality theorem. For an efficient solution, the MPEC is approximated as a mixed-integer linear program by applying the Fortuny-Amat transform on the complementarity and slackness conditions and the binary expansion on the bilinear terms. The uncertainties of the renewables, loads, and prices are modeled using stochastic scenarios. Finally, comparative case studies of a VPP in an IEEE 33 node active distribution network show that the proposed model improves the profit by strategic cooperative energy transactions.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the context of renewable energy sources, virtual power plants (VPP) are regarded as a key technology for an intelligent control of the complex, decentralized, distributed and heterogeneous power generation process. However, an economic and ecological control of a VPP turns out to be a highly critical task: due to the strongly varying characteristics of VPPs, in terms of complexity, technology mix, environmental conditions and target objectives to be optimized during operation, the control of an individual VPP needs to be able to effectively take into account all of those individual constraints. Therefore, we propose in this paper an abstract control methodology for a VPP in combination with computational intelligence (CI) metaheuristics, which is designed to be flexibly applicable for different VPP sizes, target objectives and power plant types. The methodology furthermore provides the possibility to build hierarchical VPPs as they are often demanded by the system operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the control methodology, three exemplary optimization targets are considered and applied to different compositions of flat/hierarchical VPPs: the minimization of operating reserve requirements, the minimization of CO 2 emissions and the maximization of the power plant flexibility. Furthermore, the methodology is combined and evaluated with three exemplary CI metaheuristics: simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO). To legitimize the use of such advanced CI metaheuristics for the optimization problem, gradient descent optimization (GDO) as a traditional optimization technique is regarded as well. On the basis of concrete example scenarios as well as extensive, aggregated test runs, the results show that the control methodology is capable of efficiently optimizing various compositions of VPPs towards the given objectives. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The electric water heater may be regarded as a 'uni-directional battery' and a major component of a hybrid residential energy storage system. One of the main constraints of implementing demand response with EWH relates to the unpredictable customer behavior, which influences the domestic water tank temperature as well as the EWH operation cycle. This study analyzes the operation of multiple water heaters and develops an aggregated generic water heater load curve for the average residential customer based on experimental data retrieved from the A.O. Smith Corporation. An equivalent thermal model capable of capturing the typical customer behavior and estimating the per unit hot water usage was developed. The proposed aggregated generic EWH load curve was validated through an example demand response program, in which the morning peak demand is shed in order to store the surplus PV power at midday in the EWH. Based on the representative hot water draw profile and the electric power profile, the change in average tank temperature was estimated and maintained within the customer acceptable range. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy Sharing Systems (ESS) are envisioned to be the future of power systems. In these systems, consumers equipped with renewable energy generation capabilities are able to participate in an energy market to sell their energy. This paper proposes an ESS that, differently from previous works, takes into account the consumers' preference, engagement, and bounded rationality. The problem of maximizing the energy exchange while considering such user modeling is formulated and shown to be NP-Hard. To learn the user behavior, two heuristics are proposed: 1) a Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm, which provides a bounded regret and 2) a more computationally efficient heuristic, named BPT- K, with guaranteed termination and correctness. A comprehensive experimental analysis is conducted against state-of-the-art solutions using realistic datasets. Results show that including user modeling and learning provides significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, the proposed algorithms result in 25% higher efficiency and 27% more transferred energy. Furthermore, the learning algorithms converge to a value less than 5% of the optimal solution in less than 3 months of learning.  © 2017 IEEE.},

However, VPP operation subject to network limits and different market and physical uncertainties is a challenging task. This paper introduces a framework that co-optimizes the VPP provision of multiple market (e.g., energy, reserve), system (e.g., fast frequency response, inertia, upstream reactive power), and local network (e.g., voltage support) services with the aim of maximizing its revenue. To ensure problem tractability, while accommodating the uncertain nature of market prices, local demand, and renewable output and while operating within local network constraints, the framework is broken down into three sequentially coordinated optimization problems. Specifically, a scenario-based robust optimization for day-ahead resource scheduling, with linearized power flows, and two receding horizon optimizations for close-to-real-time dispatch, with a more accurate second-order cone relaxation of the power flows. The results from a real Australian case study demonstrate how the framework enables effective deployment of VPP flexibility to maximize its multi-service value stack, within an uncertain operating environment, and within technical limits.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

This article presents an auction-based energy management solution from VPP aggregator point of view. To this end, a network-constrained economic dispatch has been developed taking into account a comprehensive resource portfolio, including the conventional and renewable distributed generations, energy storage units, and flexible loads. The VPP aggregator aims at minimizing its expected costs through optimal dispatch of its own resources as well as purchasing and selling electricity from/to upstream network. To this end, a stochastic programming approach has been employed to consider the generation uncertainty of renewable energy resources as well as day-ahead energy market prices using a set of plausible scenarios. The payments to the prosumers are according to an auction-based pricing method that could be an efficient strategy for the VPP aggregator in order to guarantee fairness among consumers and producers within the VPP. In the auction-based pricing scheme, the electricity price at each local node can be calculated according to the demand and generation in each time slot. The proposed framework is a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved by the CPLEX solver in the GAMS software. It is noteworthy that the effectiveness of the model has been verified, considering several numerical studies.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to limited fossil fuel resources, a growing increase in energy demand and the need to maintain positive environmental effects, concentrating solar power (CSP) plant as a promising technology has driven the world to find new sustainable and competitive methods for energy production. The scheduling capability of a CSP plant equipped with thermal energy storage (TES) surpasses a photovoltaic (PV) unit and augments the sustainability of energy system performance. However, restricting CSP plant application compared to a PV plant due to its high investment is a challenging issue. This paper presents a model to assemble a combined heat and power (CHP) with a CSP plant for enhancing heat utilization and reduce the overall cost of the plant, thus, the CSP benefits proved by researches can be implemented more economically. Moreover, the compressed air energy storage (CAES) is used with a CSP-TES-CHP plant in order that the thermoelectric decoupling of the CHP be facilitated. Therefore, the virtual power plant (VPP) created is a suitable design for large power grids, which can trade heat and electricity in response to the market without restraint by thermoelectric constraint. Furthermore, the day-ahead offering strategy of the VPP is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem with the goal of maximizing the profit in the market. The simulation results prove the efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed VPP has a 2% increase in profit and a maximum 6% increase in the market electricity price per day compared to the system without CAES. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this article, it is proposed to dynamically cluster the energy storage systems into several virtual power plants based on the energy storage systems' power demands and capacities. This results in reduced network power losses. The proposed dynamic clustering algorithm enables to cluster agents (energy storage systems) based on their preselected feature states (local power demands and energy storage capacities). To determine the clusters, the distance of the agents' current feature states from the average estimates of the states is determined in all clusters. The algorithm also provides average estimates of designated auxiliary states that can be used for control purposes.

	abstract = {This article presents low-frequency ripple power steering control strategies for a power conversion topology that comprises a high frequency linked three-port converter (HFL-TPC) and a voltage source inverter (VSI) for PV-BESS/EV applications. The proposed topology has three interfaces, which can be connected with a photovoltaic (PV) port, battery energy storage systems (BESS) and/or electric vehicles (EVs) port, and a four-quadrant ac port. The proposed topology inherently exhibits double line frequency (DLF) power fluctuation that needs to be decoupled and steered away from the PV port. In this article, we have developed and demonstrated two control strategies to deal with the DLF ripple. The first control strategy utilizes loop gain of the closed loop control system to decouple the DLF power, however, a residual DLF power still exists at the ac port. To completely decouple the DLF fluctuations, an improved sequence-based control strategy is proposed where the DLF voltage components are converted into positive and negative sequence components and controlled separately on their respective synchronous reference frames. To verify the practical feasibility of the proposed low-frequency ripple power steering control strategies, a 40 V, 400 W HFL-TPC is built and tested. Experimental results show that the proposed methods decouple the DLF power fluctuation and selectively steer it to the BESS/EV port. Comparative results reveal that the sequence-based control strategy shows a higher degree of DLF ripple suppression.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) has arisen over a decade ago from the relatively low competitiveness of the back then emerging non-dispatchable RES. A set of smaller generators imitates the behavior of large synchronous generators. So far, static aspects such as generation or slow dynamics have been of interest, as it is the case for the zonal secondary frequency control scheme in Spain, which can be viewed as a VPP. However, considering dynamic aspects is of high importance, especially to further increase the current penetration level of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Indeed, one should deal with the full participation of RES in grid ancillary services. This means not only to get some positive impact on grid voltage and frequency dynamics but to bring concepts which allow integrating RES to existing secondary regulation schemes on the same level as classic synchronous generators. For that, we propose here a new concept called Dynamic VPP (DVPP) which fully integrates the dynamic aspects at all levels: locally (for each RES generator), globally (for grid ancillary services and interaction with other close-by elements of the grid) and economically (for internal optimal dispatch and participation in electricity markets). A DVPP is a set of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES along with a set of common control and operation procedures. The latter procedures include the choice of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES constituting the DVPP, the control of DVPP generators for local objectives and participation of the DVPP as a single unit in ancillary services (especially in case of loss of natural resources-e.g., wind, sun-on a part of the DVPP), the limitation of the risk of adversely interaction with close-by elements and the feasibility in both current power systems scenarios and future ones with large share of RES. This new DVPP framework and approaches developed for its implementation allows ensuring optimal operation of a mixed portfolio of dispatchable and non-dispatchable RES generators for planning, participation to the markets and real-time control. For the control, all time-scale dynamics are considered to improve RES management (internal re-dispatch inside the DVPP to take advantage of dispatchable/non-dispatchable nature of each RES and to optimally manage the lack of natural resources in some regions of the DVPP) and their participation to grid ancillary services. Concrete structures of DVPP as well as ways to address the other control and economical aspects will be shown. This new DVPP concept is now under development in the H2020 POSYTYF project (https://posytyf-h2020.eu/). © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) comprising renewables and hydrogen production through power-to-gas technologies can help to increase renewable penetration and to improve operational flexibility and economic performance. However, the uncertainty inherent to forecasts of renewable generation and energy prices renders cost effective operation difficult. The present paper approaches the issue by means of receding-horizon stochastic optimization (i.e. by stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC)). Differently from previous works, we do not tackle computational tractability with a sampling-based approach, but by mapping quantile forecasts of virtual energy profiles to the mode of operation that has the highest probability of being optimal. This way, we reduce the computational load and the forecasting burden. Furthermore, simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm can attain a significant percentage of the revenue of optimal control with perfect forecasts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The electricity grids are transforming due to the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and new types of loads. As a result, the operational and planning regimes of power grids are evolving, which requires new types of service options, technological responses, and management strategies. The virtual power plant (VPP) emerged in the electricity grid recently to tackle the grid challenges caused by the intermittent generation resources and subsequent market reforms as a VPP can inter-network a number of energy resources to act as a single energy resource. This paper proposes a method to implement a price-signal controlled market-based model of a VPP, which would be suitable to mimic a large commercial and industrial (CI) customer equipped with flexible loads, solar PV, biofuel, and diesel generators. This study analyses the operation of a VPP with two VPP control algorithms based on the variation (i.e., very low and very high) of the electricity market price. The modified IEEE 9 bus network is used to develop and simulate the VPP model in MATPOWER, which is an open-source MATLAB based power system simulation package. The simulated results showcase the response of the VPP to the negative and high electricity spot price and how the control algorithm turn on/off its generator(s) and load units to gain the least operational cost for large CI customer. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A hierarchical control architecture is proposed for the optimal day-ahead commitment of multiple grid support services within a virtual power plant (VPP). The day-ahead optimization considers pricing and cost data to determine the commitment schedule, and a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is included to minimize the unbalance fees during real-time operations. The multi-level control has been demonstrated experimentally using a hybrid test system, where the VPP is formed of a commercial 240 kW, 180 kWh battery energy storage system (BESS), while the additional assets are modelled in a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). Two case studies are analyzed: the first assumes a purely-electrical VPP, with a single connection to the public network; the second involves a multi-energy approach, with the introduction of a gas-supplied Combined Heat and Power unit (CHP). Both winter and summer price scenarios are tested. The results show the superiority of the multiple-service operation compared to providing a single grid support service. For example, the net revenue is increased by 30% (winter) and 7% (summer) when compared to just frequency regulation, and by +99% (winter) and 30% (summer) when compared to only energy arbitrage. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

This paper presents a smart energy management solution from virtual power plant aggregator point of view. To this end, a network-constrained economic dispatch has been developed taking into account a comprehensive resource portfolio including conventional and renewable distributed generations, energy storage units, and flexible loads. The virtual power plant aggregator aims at minimizing its expected costs through optimal dispatch of its own resources as well as purchasing and selling electricity from/to upstream network. To this end, a stochastic programming approach has been employed to consider the generation uncertainty of renewable energy resources using a set of plausible scenarios. The proposed framework is a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved by the CPLEX solver in the GAMS software. It is noteworthy that, the effectiveness of the model has been verified considering several numerical studies. © 2021 IEEE},

At the same time, insufficient research on optimal scheduling of multi-energy virtual power plants under multiple uncertainties. Here we propose a robust stochastic optimal dispatching method to solve the scheduling problem under multiple uncertainties. For the source side uncertainties, the uncertain set of cardinalities with a robust adjustable coefficient is adopted to describe the output of wind turbines and photovoltaics. For the load side uncertainties, the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty is used to generate electric, thermal, cooling, and natural gas load scenarios, and the K-medoids clustering is used to get typical scenes. A two-stage robust stochastic optimal model of the min-max-min structure was established. Based on the dual transformation theory and the column constraint generation algorithm, the original model was solved alternately. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified by simulation analysis. The proposed method can get the scheduling scheme with the lowest operating cost in the worst scenario and is conducive to reducing the overall scheduling cost of the system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Modern active distribution networks (ADNs) have become more resilient to service interruptions due to the flexibility offered by integrated distributed energy resources (DERs). Compared to network-owned DERs, directly controlled by the distribution system operator (DSO), a vast majority of DERs controlled by independent virtual power plants (VPPs) are much more difficult to coordinate. The coordination with the VPPs and the management of uncertainty are the two major obstacles in the utilization of these DERs in the ADN restoration (ADNR). This article proposes a hierarchical framework for the sequential ADNR to overcome these two obstacles. The proposed framework adaptively integrates the sequential ADNR planning and the VPP scheduling models based on a comprehensive DSO and VPP coordination scheme to quantify and include the flexibility of VPPs in the ADNR. Furthermore, to address the uncertainty of renewable DERs and loads, a chance-constraint (CC) approach is used in these models. As the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters are not fully known, a distributionally robust reformulation for CCs is proposed that ensures that the solution is robust to any uncertainty distribution defined within a moment-based ambiguity set. The DR reformulation is further linearized to achieve DRCC mixed-integer linear-programming models for ADNR planning and VPP scheduling. Finally, its effectiveness is evaluated on the IEEE 123 node ADN.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The resilience of an active distribution network (ADN) is continuously threatened by extreme incidents. Cascading failures are the cause of most large-scale network outages in such events. Planning for resilient ADN operations under catastrophic emergencies is thus necessary for the distribution system operator. Fortunately, grid-edge flexibility can be a valuable tool in enabling resilience. This paper proposes a cooperative planning approach for the optimal partitioning and operation of ADNs with integrated VPPs in the form of multiple interconnected microgrids capable of successful islanded operation. On the grid edge, virtual power plants operate and control the distributed energy resources (DERs) and thus facilitate the ADN operation during emergencies. The uncertainty of the renewable DERs is, however, a challenge. Therefore, the proposed ADN partitioning model is formulated as a stochastic linear programming problem. Further, the operation model is based on the stochastic model predictive control technique. It has two parts: 1) the receding horizon day-ahead operation, and 2) the feedback correction for real-time operation. In the first part, the receding horizon day-ahead schedule is calculated following the latest forecast-based scenarios. In the second part, the receding schedule is adjusted based on the real-time forecast. Its effectiveness is assessed on IEEE 123 node ADN. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wind and solar are renewable sources characterized by a great potential but a variable and unpredictable nature. Characteristics that provoke mismatch between power supply and demand which in turns are the source of network control issues. Problems manageable with the installation of large-scale energy storage like Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES). To this purpose, the paper presents a techno-economic analysis for assessing the benefits deriving from the hybridization of a seawater PHES (sPHES) plant with an in-operation wind farm. Plants work as a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) instead of two separate unit. The hybridization aims to avoid the unbalances of the wind farm, having negative impact on both the grid and the wind farm owner itself. The unbalances cause unpredictable deviations from the predicted production and, hence, power production fluctuations faced by the grid with curtailments and/or calls in operation of fossil-fuelled power plants. A VPP techno-economic optimization on a daily bases is performed using the ASD-PSO algorithm while the optimization aim is the revenue maximization. Results show that a VPP composed by a sPHES and a wind farm and with a single owner, is able to manage the wind farm production, improving the revenue of 6.8% compared to plants acting separately on the market. The VPP approach is also convenient in the case of a joint venture between the plants owners. But, in this case, the revenue is increased only of 0.4% compared to plants working separately. Finally, results also highlight that, in the Italian electricity market, a sPHES plant alone is not able to generate sufficient revenue to guarantee a reasonable payback time while coupling it with a wind farm increases incomes and working days and avoid cost and grid issues in managing the unpredictable wind farm production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and controllable loads can be aggregated as virtual power plants (VPPs) to provide frequency regulation services for managing power system stability. Optimizing the profits of PV-BESS VPPs in frequency control markets can demonstrate their profitability and encourage more PV-BESS consumers to join VPPs to support the grid. This article proposes an optimal bidding strategy of a PV-BESS VPP in frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) markets, and a joint bidding strategy of the VPP in cooperation with a wind farm, which aims to maximize their cooperation profits. Moreover, the battery cycle life is systematically considered and incorporated in the proposed bidding models. In addition, a payoff allocation approach based on Nash-Harsanyi Bargaining Solution is innovatively developed to allocate the extra profit of the cooperation. The proposed approach is expected to allocate the VPP with a reasonable share and reflect its real contribution in cooperation. The simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bidding models and the payoff allocation approach.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To integrate large-scale renewable energy into energy systems, an effective participation from private investors and active customer engagement are essential. Virtual power plants (VPPs) are a very promising approach. To realize this engagement, an efficient monitoring and control system needs to be implemented for the VPP to be flexible, scalable, secure, and cost-effective. In this paper, a realistic VPP in Western Australia is studied, comprising 67 dwellings, including a 810 kW rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system, a 700 kWh vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), a heat pump hot water system (HWS), an electric vehicle (EV) charging station, and demand management mechanisms. The practical and detailed concept design of the monitoring and control system for EEBUS-enabled appliances, and also for the PV and VRFB system, with smart inverters, is proposed. In addition, a practical fog-based storage and computing system is developed to enable the VPP owner to manage the PV, VRFB, and EV charging station for maximizing the benefit to the customers and the VPP owner. Further, the proposed cloud-based applications enable customers to participate in gamified demand response programs for increasing the level of their engagement while satisfying their comfort level. All proposed systems and architecture in this paper have the capability of being implemented fully and relevant references for practical devices are given where necessary. © 2021 by the authors.

The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and the proliferation of networked energy devices have opened up new opportunities for coordinated control of smaller residential loads at large scales to achieve similar benefits. In this paper, we present VPeak, an approach that uses residential loads volunteered by their owners for coordinated control by a utility for grid optimizations. Since the use of volunteer resources comes with hard limits on how frequently they can be used by a remote utility, we present machine learning techniques for carefully selecting which days to operate these loads based on expected peak demand. VPeak uses a distributed and heterogeneous pool of volunteer loads to implement flexible peak shaving that can either selectively target hotspots within the distribution network or perform grid-wide peak shaving. Our results show that VPeak is able to shave up to 26% of the total demand when selectively shaving peaks at local hotspots and up to 46.7% of the demand for grid-wide peak shaving. © 2021 ACM.},

Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is a novel concept that will integrate the small distributed energy resources and will act as a single conventional power plant in the electricity market. As a core energy management system in VPP, the energy should be dispatched optimally for achieving the maximum profit. Therefore, smart energy management is developed in this article of VPP with Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Internet of Things (IoT) in a unified market environment that integrates the DA and RT market. The cost characteristics for the interruptible load, battery storage system are modelled individually. The PLC and IoT based automation is proposed for optimal dispatch strategy of VPP. The proposed scheme can efficiently handle the energy demand for the VPP domain. Four different scenarios are considered with different loading conditions for validation of the concept of smart energy management.

The demand for implementing renewable energy, therefore, has risen. This paper proposes dealing with installing the battery capability system on retail sites by setting up a virtual power plant. It is preferable that the batteries are grid-connected and potentially linked to solar photovoltaic (PV). The virtual power plant with the grid-connected solar PV system will work towards meeting the changing load demands. Also, the paper considers utilizing the excess energy in the grid after meeting the load demand at the retail sites to operate ultra-fast charging points for the electric vehicles. It will charge the battery quicker in terms of the conventional battery charging structure. Three approaches have been considered, which are- grid-connected PV with battery storage system, grid-connected battery storage system without PV modules and just a battery storage system. Besides, future aspects of the paper, such as ultra-fast charging and Vehicle to Home (V2H) and Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technologies are also explored. This paper focused on the analysis and calculation of the installation cost which is estimated at around 25, 000, annual savings of 2920 and payback period of the system is calculated to be around 9 years, which showed the feasibility of the virtual plant.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Operational challenges are expected when a large amount of wind and solar energy is added to the electricity system. It is necessary to introduce new technologies to allow more energy portfolio integration into power systems in order to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) such as wind and solar power due to their fluctuating nature. A possible solution to the problem of renewable energy integration in power market transactions is the idea of a virtual power plant (VPP). A VPP is a novel and smart approach of integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) such as demand response (DR) and energy storage system (ESS). A VPP could exploit DERs and demand-side participation to mitigate peak loads and thus sustain grid stability. This paper presents a DR strategy of a VPP for simulating energy transactions within the VPP internal electricity market. The method assesses the impact of the DR program on renewable energies integration aiming to minimize VPP operating costs over the short-term planning horizon. Stochastic programming theory is used to address the optimization problem while protecting the interests of the end users. Preliminary findings show that peak load has been reduced while the overall cost of operating has decreased.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Meanwhile, this increasing proportion of DERs in the ADNs also provides an ideal opportunity for VPP based integrated energy systems (VES) to provide active as well as reactive power support. This paper proposes a bi-level energy management model to study the strategic behavior of a profit-driven VES in the distribution energy market (DEM). In the upper-level, the VES submits its offers and bids for both active and reactive powers in terms of price and quantity to the DEM. In the lower level, the overall operation cost of an ADN is minimized to clear the DEM. The network constraints are represented by an optimal power flow problem, while the uncertainty in the renewable energy is modeled by the chance constraints. For an efficient solution, the proposed bi-level energy management model is converted into a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) that is framed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using linearization methods. The simulation results from a case study on a VES in an ADN of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.},

The customized pricing mechanisms are required for an effective DR to target the potential consumers accurately. This paper proposes a frequency control ancillary service and critical peak rebate (FCAS-CPR) strategy based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) for a virtual power plant (VPP) in coupled FCAS and DR markets. In order to develop a customized pricing model in the proposed strategy, the load clustering technique is applied. This aims to classify the loads based on the typical characteristics of consumers' reactions to ETs. The consumers' load reactions to ETs are described by the peak temperature sensitivity and the lag length. Then, the subjective decisions of irrational consumers are reflected based on the CPT. Last, the interaction between VPP consumers and the retailer is modeled as a Stackelberg game and solved by the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed FCAS-CPR pricing mechanism, which can efficiently reduce the peak loads to mitigate impacts of ETs on power systems, while achieving a win-win outcome in maximizing the utilities of both the retailer and VPP consumers.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a cyber-physical algorithm for grid-interactive Distributed Energy Resource (DER) control to enable two features of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) dispatch and grid voltage regulation, considering the communication and security impacts. We first formulate the DER dispatch problem as a real-time, iterative, and grid-interactive DER control problem. Thereafter, we consider a probabilistic traffic model to characterize packet delays and loss in a communication network, and study how the delays enter the process of information exchange among the grid measurement units, local DER controllers and the grid control center that coordinately execute this dispatch algorithm. Finally, a strategy combining delay threshold and modified message update rules is proposed to immune the asynchrony resulting from the communications network traffic and it avoids possible numerical instabilities and sensitivities of the tracking and regulation capabilities of this DER control algorithm. By implementing the proposed cyber-physical algorithm on the modified IEEE 37-node system, our preliminary results exhibit that the uncertainties of the underlying communications infrastructure must be considered for the VPP tracking and regulation capabilities of any DER in a generic Cyber-Physical System (CPS), because the delayed voltage measurements in the uplink/bi-link cases result in the off-track in VPP dispatch and jittery in voltage regulation. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The advent of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles, and controllable loads, brings a significantly disruptive and transformational impact on the centralized power system. It is widely accepted that a paradigm shift to a decentralized power system with bidirectional power flow is necessary to the integration of DERs. The virtual power plant (VPP) emerges as a promising paradigm for managing DERs to participate in the power system. In this paper, we develop a blockchain-based VPP energy management platform to facilitate a rich set of transactive energy activities among residential users with renewables, energy storage, and flexible loads in a VPP. Specifically, users can interact with each other to trade energy for mutual benefits and provide network services, such as feed-in energy, reserve, and demand response, through the VPP. To respect the users’ independence and preserve their privacy, we design a decentralized optimization algorithm to optimize the users’ energy scheduling, energy trading, and network services. Then we develop a prototype blockchain network for VPP energy management and implement the proposed algorithm on the blockchain network. By experiments using real-world data trace, we validated the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm and the blockchain system. The simulation results demonstrate that our blockchain-based VPP energy management platform reduces the users’ cost by up to 38.6% and reduces the overall system cost by 11.2%. © 2021},

	abstract = {Extreme incidents can cause diverse and dynamic disruptions to active distribution networks (ADNs). Thus, ADN operators (DNOs) must plan to prepare for and adapt to changes in conditions to withstand and quickly recover from such disruptions. This article proposes a cooperative planning framework to design optimal microgrids (MGs) in smart ADNs integrated with virtual power plants (VPPs) to quickly reconfigure and recover during such events. The proposed framework has two parts: 1) optimal partitioning of ADNs with integrated VPPs into supply-sufficient MGs; and 2) the scheduling of the partitioned MGs. Since the VPPs are autonomous, a smart DNO and VPP interface and operating model for dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs) is proposed to quantify and integrate the supply capacity of VPPs in the operation of MGs. As part of this framework, three optimization models are formulated including VPP optimization, ADN partitioning, and a partitioned ADN scheduling model, where the uncertainty of renewables, loads, and prices is modeled as stochastic scenarios. In part one, the VPP optimization model quantifies the available supply of VPPs. Then, the ADN partitioning model derives the optimal MGs by utilizing the supply of VPPs and network resources. In part two, based on the available supply of VPPs, the partitioned ADN scheduling model derives a day-ahead schedule for the MGs and the DOEs for VPPs. VPPs can then reoptimize to maximize their export within the DOEs. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on IEEE 13 and 123 node test networks, and the results are presented.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Solar energy penetration has been on the rise worldwide during the past decade, attracting a growing interest in solar power forecasting over short time horizons. The increasing integration of these resources without accurate power forecasts hinders the grid operation and discourages the use of this renewable resource. To overcome this problem, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) provide a solution to centralize the management of several installations to minimize the forecasting error. This paper introduces a method to efficiently produce intra-day accurate Photovoltaic (PV) power forecasts at different locations, by using free and available information. Prediction intervals, which are based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), account for the forecast uncertainty which provides additional information about the VPP node power generation. The performance of the forecasting strategy has been verified against the power generated by a real PV installation, and a set of ground-based meteorological stations in geographical proximity have been used to emulate a VPP. The forecasting approach is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and shows similar errors to those obtained with other deep learning methods published in the literature, offering a MAE performance of 44.19 W/m2 under different lead times and launch times. By applying this technique to 8 VPP nodes, the global error is reduced by 12.37% in terms of the MAE, showing huge potential in this environment. © 2021 by the authors.

For several reasons, self-organizing, agent-based systems are probably the best technology for coordination. A major drawback of many currently existing solutions is the necessity to communicate plain information for negotiation and optimization. Such information contains e.g. possible energy generation schemes or aggregated costs. Previous works have already shown that identification of anonymously sent information is possible. In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of disaggregating cost structure information as an example of possible leakage of business information in the case of participation in virtual power plants or district energy systems. From this perspective, we derive measures to ensure privacy preservation in decentralized coordination algorithms. © 2022 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI). All rights reserved.},

We operate under price and wind production uncertainty and in order to handle it, methods of machine learning are employed. For price modeling, we take into account the latest trends in the field and the most up-to-date events affecting the day-ahead and intra-day prices. The performance of our price models is demonstrated by both statistical methods and improvements in the profits of the virtual power plant. Optimization methods will take price and imbalance forecasts as input and conduct parallelization, decomposition, and splitting methods in order to handle sufficiently large numbers of assets in a VPP. The main focus is on the speed of computing optimal solutions of large-scale mixed-integer linear programming problems, and the best speed-up is in two orders of magnitude enabled by our method which we called Gradual Increase.

Such an aggregated unit can not only leverage the internal benefits of acting as a single unit, for example, by reducing imbalance errors and respective payments but also by offering a larger variety of products and services to the system than each unit could offer individually. Based on empirical generation and market data, the presented analysis outlines the added benefit of the socalled value stacking implementing the balance of forecast errors, the exploitation of short-term arbitrage opportunities, and the provision of secondary and tertiary frequency reserve. A multi-stage and multiperiod optimization approach is presented to generate an aggregated bidding strategy on multiple energy and ancillary service markets. On the one hand, the results highlight the value of individual operation modes for the plant and, on the other hand, the aggregated benefit of value stacking with multiple combined operating modes. The provided empirical insights are beneficial for both potential investing parties that want to evaluate the potential value of combined plants and policymakers that consider further regulatory amendments to open markets and enable further integration of new energy sources. © 2021 ICAE.},

However, current simulation tools underestimate their operating costs, which jeopardises their efficient use and deployment. This paper proposes a strategy based on artificial intelligence and time series prediction for the planning and real-time management of a battery energy storage system in a micro-grid acting as a virtual power plant. An economic analysis was performed, and the findings suggested that the state of charge should be managed to avoid economic losses due to cycle ageing. In addition, the battery should be sized correctly to ensure its economic viability, which indicates that it should be optimised according to the load profile of the micro-grid. The proposed management strategy was demonstrated to avoid the economic losses observed with a non-managed storage system. In addition, ensuring that the micro-grid did not deviate from the load profile agreed upon with the transmission system operator was found to increase economic returns, reduce battery degradation and increase self-consumption with the co-benefit of reducing micro-grid fluctuations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The building sector is one of the major contributors to energy demand. Therefore, policy makers and the public are increasingly aware of the need to address global energy sustainability challenges in the building sector. With the growing prevalence of digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI), energy supplying infrastructures are undergoing profound changes by the emergence of smart buildings. Smart buildings aim to not only control devices and appliances inside, but can also create active micro-grids or virtual power plants by adapting to grid’s conditions and communicating with other buildings. The great potential to provide flexibility for the integration of fluctuating renewable energy make smart buildings one of the central elements in the future energy system. Although smart building technologies are widely introduced and discussed in academia and industry, its services in real life are still rare. If smart buildings should unfold their potential contribution to the future energy system, one important barrier to overcome is the adoption of these technologies by households and investors. To analyse where the barriers in the adoption decision lie, we apply multiple visual analysis approaches. First, keyword extraction together with network visualization is used to identify the most trending sub-topics of smart building concept. Second, a text mining approach is applied to discover how smart building concepts diffuse over time and spatially based on scraped social media posts and online news. Third, this paper further analyses the user engagement degree in the diffusion of smart building concepts by user profile mining. The paper concludes with deriving recommendations on how (nudging) policies could be designed and how smart building technologies could be enhanced to increase user adaptation. © 2021 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

HVAC system modeling facilitates the study of demand response (DR) at both the residential and power system levels. In this article, the equivalent thermal model of a reference house is proposed. Parameters for the reference house were determined based on the systematic study of experimental data obtained from fully instrumented field demonstrators. Energy storage capacity of HVAC systems is calculated and an equivalent state-of-charge is defined. The uniformity between HVAC systems and battery energy storage system is demonstrated by DR control. The aggregated HVAC load model is based on the reference house and considers a realistic distribution of HVAC parameters derived from one of the largest smart grid field demonstrators in rural America. A sequential DR scheme as part of a virtual power plant control is proposed to reduce both ramping rate and peak power at the aggregated level, while maintaining human comfort according to ASHRAE standards.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electricity markets are fast changing because of the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable generation, leading to a growing need for the flexible operation of power plants to provide regulation services to the grid. Previous studies have suggested that conventional power plants (e.g., nuclear) may benefit from the integration of thermal energy storage (TES), as this enables greater flexibility. In conventional Rankine-cycle power plants, steam can be extracted during off-peak periods to charge TES tanks filled with phase-change materials (PCMs); at a later time, when this is required and/or economically favourable, these tanks can feed secondary thermal power plants to generate power, for example, by acting as evaporators of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) plants. This solution offers greater flexibility than TES-only solutions that store thermal energy and then release this back to the base power plant, as it allows both derating and over-generation. The solution is applied here to a specific case study of a 670 MWel nuclear power plant in the UK, which is a typical baseload power plant not intended for flexible operation. It is found a maximum combined power of 822 MWel can be delivered during peak demand, which is 23% higher than the base plant's (nominal) rated power, and a maximum derating of 40%, i.e., down to 406 MWel during off-peak demand. An operational energy management strategy (EMS) is then proposed for optimising the charging of the TES tanks during off-peak demand periods and for controlling the discharging of the tanks for electricity generation during peak-demand periods. An economic analysis is performed to evaluate the potential benefits of this EMS. Profitability in the case study considered here can result when the average peak and off-peak electricity price variations are at least double those that occurred in the UK market in 2019 (with recent data now close to this), and when TES charge/discharge cycles are performed more than once per day with a discharge duration to the ORC plants longer than 2 h. When considering the most recent UK electricity prices in 2021 (to-date), the EMS investment cost for one 1-h charge and 1-h discharge cycle per day is 199 m£ with a total generation of 50 GWh per year and a levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of 463 £/MWh. The investment cost drops significantly to 48 m£ when discharging for a longer duration of 8 h as the size of the ORC plants decrease. The projected LCOE also decreases to 159 £/MWh when doubling the total generated electricity (100 GWh/year) by employing two 8-h TES charge/discharge cycles per day. Importantly, it is found that the economics of the EMS are determined by a trade-off between longer discharge durations to the ORC plants that minimises their size and cost, and shorter charge/discharge durations that yield the highest spread between off-peak and peak electricity prices. © 2021},

We ensure reliable operations by using a joint chance constraint. Models with a few hundred scenarios are relatively tractable; for larger models, we demonstrate how a Lagrangian relaxation scheme provides improved results. To further accelerate the Lagrangian scheme, we embed the progressive hedging algorithm within the subgradient iterations of the Lagrangian relaxation. We investigate several enhancements of the progressive hedging algorithm, and find bundling of scenarios results in the best bounds.

	abstract = {The mushrooming of distributed energy resources turns end-users from passive price-takers to active market-participants. To manage massive proactive end-users efficiently, virtual power plant (VPP) as an innovative concept emerges. It can provide some necessary information to help consumers improve their profits and trade with the electricity market on behalf of them. One important information desired by consumers is the prediction of renewable outputs inside this VPP. Presently, most VPPs run in a centralized manner, which means the VPP predicts the outputs of all the renewable sources it manages and provides the predictions to every consumer who buys this information. We prove that providing predictions can boost social total surplus. However, with more consumers and renewables in the market, this centralized scheme needs extensive data communication and may jeopardize the privacy of individual stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a decentralized prediction provision algorithm in which consumers from each subregion only buy local predictions and exchange information with the VPP. Convergence is proved under a mild condition, and the demand gap between centralized and decentralized schemes is proved to have zero expectation and bounded variance. Illustrative examples show that the variance of this gap decreases with more consumers and higher uncertainty.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

Instead of modelling the decision-making process as an optimisation problem, a reinforcement learning method is used to seek the optimal strategy, which could update its performance with minimal manpower manipulation. Specifically, the data collection from several commercial buildings, including hotel, shopping mall and office, in Huangpu district, Shanghai city is analysed to deploy the demand response program. Compared with the conventional demand response strategy based on optimisation, the learnt strategy does not rely on the forecasting information as input and could adapt to the changing demand response incentive automatically.

	abstract = {The rapid penetration of photovoltaic generation reduces power grid inertia and increases the need for intelligent energy resources that can cope in real time with the imbalance between power generation and consumption. Virtual power plants are a technology for coordinating such resources and monetizing them, for example on electricity markets with real-time pricing or on frequency reserves markets. Accurate short-term photovoltaic generation forecasts are essential for such virtual power plants. Although significant research has been done on medium- and long-term photovoltaic generation forecasting, the short-term forecasting problem requires special attention to sudden fluctuations due to the high variability of cloud cover and related weather events. Solar irradiance nowcasting aims to resolve this variability by providing reliable short-term forecasts of the expected power generation capacity. Sky images captured in proximity to the photovoltaic panels are used to determine cloud behavior and solar intensity. This is a computationally challenging task for conventional computer vision techniques and only a handful of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been proposed. In this paper, a novel multimodal approach is proposed based on two Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) that receives a temporal image modality of a stream of sky images, a temporal numerical modality of a time-series of past solar irradiance readings and cloud cover readings as inputs for irradiance nowcasting. The proposed nowcasting pipeline consists of a preprocessing module and an irradiance augmentation module that implements methods for cloud detection, Sun localization and mask generation. The complete approach was empirically evaluated on a real-world solar irradiance case study across the four seasons of the northern hemisphere, resulting in a mean improvement of 39% for multimodality. © Copyright © 2021 Haputhanthri, De Silva, Sierla, Alahakoon, Nawaratne, Jennings and Vyatkin.},

	abstract = {Electricity demand response (DR) improves the overall energy management efficiency and allows for the integration of large-scale renewable energy into the power grid through interactive management and control of the supply and demand sides. However, in China and other emerging countries (e.g., Japan and Australia) with DR programs, the DR market mechanism is not well-established. This is particularly the situation in countries where the state power system is not freely open to participate in the DR market. Previous research has proven that considerable DR resources are largely existing in the demand side; however, the dearth of a market mechanism hinders the development of DR. Hence, a feasible market mechanism is urgently required. In this study, first, the experiences in existing DR-developed markets where DR has been legally regarded as an equivalent electricity resource are investigated. Second, a pilot DR program in Shanghai representing emerging DR markets with a non-liberated electricity background is presented. Moreover, two market mechanisms are analyzed: the energy efficiency obligation mode and the electricity capacity trading mode. Finally, five feasible DR mechanisms—mandatory energy-saving, cap and trade, DR-tiered electricity tariff, price-based program, and economic and emergency DR—are proposed for China and other DR emerging countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

An overlay data grid conveys information about the state of the electricity grid, including the real-time status of demand and production. Data is thus the basis for decisions that affect electricity costs and availability of assets. It is crucial that these decisions are formed and monitored according to a well-defined governance model. No such data governance model exists today. In this paper, we focus on data governance in virtual power plants. We define the problem, insisting on the issues linked to the inherent asymmetry of this system. We propose unionization as a framing device to reason about these issues.

Then the paper proposes a new platform for power transactions and optimal dispatch based on a master-slave game optimization model.

The results of the investigated case study reveal the benefits to retail electricity companies from adopting the proposed model to aggregate and manage decentralized resources, and optimize decision-making.

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPPs) have become a driving force for the decentralized energy industry, due to their efficient management and control of distributed energy resources. Most of the operation strategies for VPPs are designed based on the day-ahead forecasts. However, the prediction errors of the renewable energy sources (RES) and loads in the power dispatch schedule can lead to a suboptimal operation. In this article, an adaptive and predictive energy management strategy for a real-time optimal operation of VPPs is proposed based on the model predictive control technique with a feedback correction (FC) to compensate for the prediction error. This strategy has two parts: 1) receding-horizon optimization (RHO), and 2) FC. In the first part, a hybrid prediction algorithm based on the integration of the time-series model and the Kalman filter is used to forecast the output powers of RES and the loads. Based on the prediction, the RHO model schedules the operation following the latest forecast information. In the second part, the receding schedule is adjusted based on the fast-rolling gray model's ultrashort-term error prediction. The FC is applied to minimize the adjustments for compensating the prediction error. The proposed strategy is implemented on a VPP in a real electricity distribution system in New South Wales, Australia. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy with a better tracking of the actual available resources and a minimal mismatch between demand and supply.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

The model of VPP was simulated and validated based on actual parameters and load data reported in Perlis, Malaysia. BBSA optimization algorithm offers the best binary fitness function to find the best cell. It creates the optimum scheduling using the actual data for wind speed, solar radiation, fuel conditions, battery charging/discharging, and specific hour demand. The developed ANN-based BBSA search for the optimal ANN parameters architecture, e.g., (the number of neurons and learning rate) that enhanced the ANN controller to predict the optimal schedules to regulate power-sharing via prioritizing the utilization of RES in place of the national grid purchases. The results of the optimal on/off status prediction of the 25 DGs showed that the ANN-BBSA gives a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.2 × 10-3 with a unity correlation coefficient. The results showed a significant reduction in the cost and emission by 41.88% and 40.7%, respectively.

The proposed robust control employs a distributed communication manner to achieve information transmission among DERs, where the unexpected time-varying delay and state-dependent noise interferences inevitably are introduced to the distributed cooperative control of power sharing for practical VPP systems. Finally, the stability and quality of whole system will be terribly reduced. Currently, there is no available approach that can solve the autonomous power sharing control problem for a VPP in the presence of such unexpected time-varying delay and noise interferences. Thus, this paper designs a cross-level distributed robust control method to achieve autonomous proportional power sharing of VPP system in mean square linear \chi-consensus. Moreover, a sufficient upper delays bound subject to state-dependent noise disturbances is given for guidance of actual control system by Lyapunov technique and the stochastic differential equation theory. Simulation results present that the designed cross-level robust control is effectiveness and robustness for the unexpected time-varying delay and noise interferences by a tested VPP system in the MATLAB/Simulink.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Air pollution, global warming, depletion of fossil fuels, and difficulty of transferring power to remote areas are some factors that have led to the growth of distributed generation. In addition, low capacity, invisibility to the independent system operator, and uncertainty in their output power has led to the scheduling of these units as a virtual power plant (VPP). In this study, a VPP including wind turbines (WT), photo-voltaic (PV) panels, conventional generator (CG), energy storage systems, and controllable loads is studied in a day-ahead and real-time market framework. Uncertainties in WT output power, PV output power, load, and market prices are modeled using the interval uncertainty method. In addition, demand response program is modeled using utility function. A new dispatchable WT, i.e. compressed air energy storage WT (CA-WT) technology, is evaluated in terms of its impact on VPP profit and uncertainty management. In order to evaluate the the benefit of investing in a CA-WT as compared to a traditional WT, two scenarios are considered. The scheduling problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program using GAMS and solved by CPLEX. Simulation is performed on a 33-bus distribution network. The results show that CA-WT effectively handles uncertainty, reduces the use of CG, and increases power sales to the markets. CA-WT increased the profit of the VPP by about 19.3 and 20.2 % respectivelu in both day-ahead and real-time market. Sensitivity analysis of VPP profit on different intervals of uncertain parameters is also investigated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the electricity sector has seen a significant increase in the number of residential battery systems, as well as increasing interest in using them to reduce demand during network peaks. Although there is an abundance of literature assessing this ability using modelled residential batteries, there is a lack of detailed assessment using deployed residential batteries. This paper analyses 1-min resolution data from 15 non-coordinated residential batteries deployed in Australia across 6 network peak demand periods. A novel metric was used to quantify errors in BESS load-following, which occurred when the batteries did not completely mitigate grid import and export even when they had sufficient energy capacity and rated power. On average the 15 batteries discharged around 25% of their rated power during network demand peaks, whereas those that load-followed discharged around 40%. Despite the small sample size, these results suggest that the outcomes from modelled batteries represent the ideal upper bound and the actual performance of some batteries is likely to be lower. This there is a need for more research into the actual operation of deployed batteries, and what this means for the current modelled findings regarding their ability to reduce demand during network peaks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the decision-making problem of a virtual power plant (VPP) involving a self-scheduling and market involvement problem under uncertainty in the wind speed and electricity prices. The problem is modeled using a risk-neutral and two risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming formulations, where the conditional value at risk is used to represent risk. A sample average approximation methodology is integrated with an adapted L-Shaped solution method, which can solve risk-neutral and specific risk-averse problems. This methodology provides a framework to understand and quantify the impact of the sample size on the variability of the results. The numerical results include an analysis of the computational performance of the methodology for two case studies, estimators for the bounds of the true optimal solutions of the problems, and an assessment of the quality of the solutions obtained. In particular, numerical experiences indicate that when an adequate sample size is used, the solution obtained is close to the optimal one. © 2021},

	abstract = {Real-time distributed clustering algorithm for aggregation of distributed energy storage systems into heterogeneous virtual power plants is proposed. Two types of virtual power plants are formed: One for provisioning the bulk (low-frequency) power demand and one for provisioning the high-frequency power demand. The proposed distributed clustering algorithm determines the virtual power plants' memberships, for each distributed energy storage system, based on each energy storage system'scapacity and owner's willingness to participate in one of the virtual power plants. The proposed distributed secondary level control system regulates each energy storage system according to each virtual power plant's operational objectives. Specifically, a balanced state of charge of all energy storage systems inside each virtual power plant is maintained. One of the virtual power plants is responsible for the frequency and voltage regulation by providing the required high-frequency power, while the other one provides the required bulk (low-frequency) power demand. In addition, the proposed clustering algorithm enables to meet a required energy capacity of the bulk virtual power plantby automatically tuning the clustering algorithm parameters. RTDS real-time technique verifies the proposed clustering algorithm and control systems on the IEEE 13 nodes power system with distributed energy storage systems and photovoltaic sources. The presented results demonstrate dynamic aggregation of energy storage systems into heterogeneous virtual power plants based on power demand whileall regulation requirements are met. © 2020 IEEE.},

To address the uncertainty issues, this paper proposes a two-stage minimax regret (MMR)-based optimization model to reach optimal VPP self-scheduling solutions, in which the underneath problem is intrinsically NP-hard. To obtain an exact solution of the formulated problem, we firstly reformulate it into a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) problem with fixed recourse, then re-solve it by adopting the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. In the numerical experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed MMR approach by comparing it with the maximin profit approach and the perfect information approach under different occasions. The results suggest that the two-stage MMR approach can achieve a near-optimal solution. Also, it is demonstrated that the performance of the MMR approach is robust in highly volatile environments and significantly penalizing balancing markets. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a decision-making framework is proposed for a virtual power plant (VPP) to participate in day-ahead (DA) and regulating market (RM) considering internal demand response (IDR) flexibility. In the proposed model, a DR exchange market (DRXM) is also introduced to cover deviations of uncertain resources and decrease VPP's imbalance penalties in the RM. The VPP can optimize its procurement expenditures by providing DR services from both IDR providers and DRXM. A market inefficiency index (MII) is defined to analyze the effect of trading energy in the DRXM on the market power of the VPP. The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level problem, in which at the upper level, the VPP maximizes its profit while at the lower level, the distribution system operator (DSO) strives to clear both DA and RM markets to maximize social welfare. The proposed problem is nonlinear and converted into a linear single-level problem through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and duality theory. The simulation results show that in high external demand response (EDR) participants, the expected profit of the VPP augments about 3% which is a substantial value for the one-day scheduling horizon. Furthermore, by providing EDR services, MII reduces which implies the EDRs preserve their economic surplus.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources prevail as a clean energy source and their penetration in the power sector is increasing day by day due to the growing concern for climate action. However, the intermittent nature of the renewable energy based-power generation questions the grid security, especially when the utilized source is solar radiation or wind flow. The intermittency of the renewable generation can be met by the integration of distributed energy resources. The virtual power plant (VPP) is a new concept which aggregates the capacities of various distributed energy resources, handles controllable and uncontrollable loads, integrates storage devices and empowers participation as an individual power plant in the electricity market. The VPP as an energy management system (EMS) should optimally dispatch the power to its consumers. This research work is proposed to analyze the optimal scheduling of generation in VPP for the day-ahead market framework using the beetle antenna search (BAS) algorithm under various scenarios. A case study is considered for this analysis in which the constituting energy resources include a photovoltaic solar panel (PV), micro-turbine (MT), wind turbine (WT), fuel cell (FC), battery energy storage system (BESS) and controllable loads. The real-time hourly load curves are considered in this work. Three different scenarios are considered for the optimal dispatch of generation in the VPP to analyze the performance of the proposed technique. The uncertainties of the solar irradiation and the wind speed are modeled using the beta distribution method and Weibull distribution method, respectively. The performance of the proposed method is compared with other evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the genetic algorithm (GA). Among these above-mentioned algorithms, the proposed BAS algorithm shows the best scheduling with the minimum operating cost of generation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In order to estimate the potential of regulating water heaters at the aggregated level, factors including user behavior, number of water heaters, and types of water heaters must be considered. This study develops generic water heater load curves based on the data retrieved from large experimental projects for resistive electric water heaters (EWHs) and heat pump water heaters (HPWHs). A community-level digital twin with scalability has been developed to capture the aggregated hot water flow and average hot temperature in the tank. The results in this paper also include the 'energy take' in line with the CTA-2045 standard and Energy Star specification. The data from the experiments demonstrated that changing from an EWH to an HPWH reduces electricity usage by approximately 70%. The case study showed that daily electricity usage could be shifted by approximately 14% and 17% by EWH and HPWHs, respectively, compared to their corresponding average power. Another case study showed that both EHWs and HPWHs, coordinated with PV to reduce morning and evening peaks, could shift approximately 22% of the daily electricity. © 2013 IEEE.},

This normal operation region is exploited as a confirmation strategy to distinguish malicious set-points that are determined by VPP cyber-layer. These malicious set-points are spawned by a cyber-attacker influencing the VPP cyber-layer. The normal operation region is based on a derived one-to-one mapping between the network internal point of common coupling (PCC) bus voltages and the cyber-layer generated set-points. This derived mapping is compared with an inverse mapping through internal PCC bus voltage monitoring for anomalies. Once, an inconsistency is witnessed by the cybersecurity analytics between the one-to-one mapping and the inverse mapping, then the initial voltage anomaly detected by the monitoring system is due to an intrusion. The developed theory is validated through simulation of a cyber attacker gradually violating the network stability boundary through manipulating the operation set-points. © 2021 IEEE.},

The costs incurred by electricity and water consumption contribute to a major portion of DC operating costs. This article addresses the day-ahead operation of a DC in the context of a virtual power plant (VPP) under the grid-connected mode. The day-ahead operation problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that considers workload schedules among server clusters, water consumption, and uncertainties of onsite renewable energy and electricity prices. In addition, the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is utilised to manage the risk caused by various uncertainties that challenge DCs, especially electricity prices. The impacts of the risk level, the water price, and uncertainty on the day-ahead operation of the DC are studied.

This paper deals with the aspect of market integration of these technologies, which are currently hampered in their use in the electricity market by the burden of high regulatory taxes. This barrier, which is substantial in Germany, is further reinforced by the widespread concept of a completely price-insensitive per-unit tax. In view of this barrier, an alternative, price-sensitive ad-valorem taxation regime is examined with regard to consumer costs, tax income and market behaviour. For this purpose, both taxation regimes are implemented in a pan-European market simulation model, which incorporates aggregators operating the distributed technologies in the German market area. The aggregators' market deployment considers regulatory costs in the objective function, thus enabling the analysis of different tax designs. © 2020 IEEE.},

The second 'flat-bidding' strategy uses deterministic forecasts for electricity prices and thermal load. The performance of the two strategies is evaluated for four months in 2016 by consecutively simulating the day-ahead auction participation and subsequent plant operation.

Appropriate control and scheduling of the battery operations, and peer-peer power flow between the homes provide a possible solutions for reducing the higher costs and uncertainties brought to grid by high solar PV penetration. The residential community studied here includes twelve homes categorized into four types depending on whether they have energy storage or rooftop solar PV panels. The homes exchange power among themselves, and the real-time electricity rate and the energy assignment for each are decided based on their individual bidding schemes. The homes benefit due to the lower electricity rate enabled by this aggregation, as compared with that available from the utility grid. In this work, the PV generation and load consumption for the different types of homes are calculated from building models.

V2G technology enables the bidirectional flow of electric energy where EVs can also discharge energy to the grid from their batteries aiming to lower the peak demand. Our V2G optimization approach employs mobility information to balance peak utilization among differently utilized distribution segments by assigning each EV to an optimal Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) enabled parking lot. By aggregating geographically dispersed EVs and micro-grids with renewable energy sources as a virtual power plant (VPP), we proposed a scalable VPP based V2G optimization architecture integrated with VANET. Compared with existing solutions, our convex optimization algorithm uses fewer variables, attains uniform utilization of grid nodes by optimal EV charging/discharging profiles. By simulation, we showed that this novel mobility-aware, scalable V2G optimization algorithm can reduce or significantly postpone the need of expensive upgrade of power distribution infrastructure. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The problem of Photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting is becoming crucial as the penetration level of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) increases in microgrids and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). In order to improve the stability of power systems, a fair amount of research has been proposed for increasing prediction performance in practical environments through statistical, machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid approaches. Despite these efforts, the problem of forecasting PV power generation remains to be challenging in power system operations since existing methods show limited accuracy and thus are not sufficiently practical enough to be widely deployed. Many existing methods using long historical data suffer from the long-term dependency problem and are not able to produce high prediction accuracy due to their failure to fully utilize all features of long sequence inputs. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning-based PV power generation forecasting model called Convolutional Self-Attention based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). By using the convolutional self-attention mechanism, we can significantly improve prediction accuracy by capturing the local context of the data and generating keys and queries that fit the local context. To validate the applicability of the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on both PV power generation forecasting using a real world dataset and power consumption forecasting. The experimental results of power generation forecasting using the real world datasets show that the MAPEs of the proposed model are much lower, in fact by 7.7%, 6%, 3.9% compared to the Deep Neural Network (DNN), LSTM and LSTM with the canonical self-attention, respectively. As for power consumption forecasting, the proposed model exhibits 32%, 17% and 44% lower Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) than the DNN, LSTM and LSTM with the canonical self-attention, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Polygeneration systems, designed for providing multiple energy services like hydrogen, heat and electricity, represent a possible solution for the transition to sustainable low-carbon energy systems, thanks to a substantial increase in the overall efficiency. A further step to reach zero-carbon energy systems can be done by using renewables as primary sources. In this study a biogas-based polygeneration system for the combined hydrogen, heat and electricity production is designed and analyzed from energy and economic points of view. The system consists of four sections: a biogas processing unit consisting in an autothermal reactor and a water gas shift reactor, an SOFC power unit, a hydrogen separation unit and a hydrogen compression/storage unit. The syngas generated in the autothermal reforming reactor is split in two fluxes: the first one is sent to the SOFC power unit for generating electricity and heat, the second one is sent to the water gas shift reactor to increase the hydrogen content. The hydrogen rich gas exiting the shifter, purified in the hydrogen separation unit (hydrogen quality is equal to 99.995%), is then compressed up to 820 bars and stored. The system behavior and the energy performances have been investigated by using the numerical simulation based on thermo-electrochemical models. Four operating conditions, related to different SOFC loads (from 30% to 100%), have been analyzed. The evaluated overall efficiencies range from 68.5% to 72.3% and the energy saving, calculated with respect to the separate production of hydrogen, heat and electricity, ranges from about 8% to 26%. The economic assessment, carried out by estimating the total capital investment and the plant profitability, has been performed by analyzing different management strategies (Base Load, Peaker, Ancillary Service and Mobility) and accounting for different technological development levels and market scenarios. Results show that the hydrogen production is the main contributor to the system economic sustainability thanks to the highest prices of hydrogen with respect to the electricity ones. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) tend to increase peak power for residences in the evening when house owners return home and begin charging. The aggregated EV charging demand can cause a sudden rise in the peak power at the distribution system level, resulting in a 'dragon curve' Such phenomenon, combined with the 'duck curve' that is caused by high photovoltaic (PV) penetration in residential communities, requires fast ramping rates and expanded capabilities for local distribution transformers and main feeder cables provided by the utility. As a solution, a residential energy storage system (RESS) can store surplus PV generation during midday and use the stored energy to support the peak power demand in the evening. House owners benefit from this strategy by avoiding electricity sales to the grid at low rates and by reducing energy usage during high Time-of-Use (ToU) periods. In this paper, a community with smart homes that include PV systems, RESSs and EVs was modeled. The EV models were developed based on data from the National Travel Household Survey (NHTS). The EV charging and RESS operation were scheduled to reduce the daily utility charge. The entire power system worked as virtual power plant as it kept the aggregated power constant for a long period of time. © 2020 IEEE.},

Failures of ICT or targeted attacks can thus have serious effects on security of supply and system stability. This paper presents a holistic approach to providing methods specifically for actors in the power system for prevention, detection, and reaction to ICT attacks and failures.

	abstract = {There have been a number of previous studies for implementing low cost and easily deployable communication networks to support smart grid services such as demand side management, automatic metering infrastructure, and virtual power plants. The outcome of the research showed us that internet based communication is the best option for low-cost, reliable and fast deployment. However, different characteristics of the internet in terms of speed and reliability should be investigated practically to help design smart grid services. In this paper, we practically evaluated the robustness of the United-Kingdom (UK) Internet network for demand response services. Further, the internet connectivity of consumer premises has been evaluated regarding its suitability for sending short control packets, in terms of packet loss and latency. From the results it can be seen that the cable broadband and fourth Generation (4G) wireless access networks have better performance in terms of packet loss and latency whereas third Generation (3G) wireless networks show significantly poorer results. © 2019 IEEE.},

One way of addressing this issue is Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), which aggregate a diverse set of DER to act in various electricity markets as a single entity. This work introduces a modelling framework which allows a VPP to operate in multiple markets, considers multiple energy vectors, and dispatches devices at 5-minute intervals, while operating within local network constraints. To ensure framework tractability, it is divided into a three-stage optimization: the high-level scheduling the devices; the mid-level dispatching them with 30-minute timesteps over a 24-hour horizon; the low-level performing the 5-minute dispatch. A real case study with electricity and hydrogen in South Australia is conducted. Results show the VPP coordinating renewable generation, dispatchable load, hydrogen storage and thermal generation to maximize earnings over multiple markets whilst adhering to local network constraints. © 2019 IEEE.},

Through the application of sector coupling energy resources, e.g., combined heat and power plants or power-to-heat, the building mass can provide flexibility to the electric power system. Within this work, a mathematical model of a building inertia thermal energy storage is proposed to allow integration into optimized smart grid control for real-world applications. It is shown how necessary model parameters can be obtained using multiple linear regression based on measurable building data. Thereby, the nonlinear characteristics of external conditions influencing the storage operation, such as outside temperature and solar irradiation, are transformed into weighted linear factors. The possibility of the ceiling surface temperature serving as a proxy for measuring the current state of energy is demonstrated. This allows real-world implementation using minimal additional hardware. Within a case study, the potential of using building storage in optimized smart grid control with sector coupling assets of a Virtual Power Plant is analyzed. The utilization of building storage compared to conventionally used hot water tanks is presented, and cost benefits for both Virtual Power Plant and building operator are shown.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The main aim is to minimize the overall cost of VPP within a fixed time horizon planning. The understudy VPP consists of wind turbine, photovoltaic system, curtailable loads, ESS, and diesel generators in which the VPP trades electricity with the upstream grid. The proposed framework investigates both optimal power and optimal energy of ESS based on the available budget for investment. To hedge against the uncertainty of investment, an efficient risk management manner based on the concept of conditional value at risk is applied. Moreover, from the reliability point of view, two reliability indices: the loss of load expectation and energy expected not served, are evaluated under different levels of investment to assess the impact of ESS on VPP reliability. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and is solved by the well-known General Algebraic Modeling System commercial software package. The effectiveness of the proposed risk-based optimization approach is demonstrated through vigorous case studies and comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Packetized energy management (PEM) is a novel bottom-up asynchronous and randomizing coordination paradigm for DERs that guarantees quality of service, autonomy, and privacy to the end-user. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation of a cyber-physical system consisting of PEM enabled DERs, flexible virtual power plants (VPPs) and transmission grid is developed in this work. A predictive, energy-constrained dispatch of aggregated PEM-enabled DERs is formulated, implemented, and validated on the HIL cyber-physical platform. The energy state of VPPs, composed of a fleet of diverse DERs distributed in the grid, depend upon the distinct real-time usage of these devices. The experimental results demonstrate that the existing control schemes, such as AGC, dispatch VPPs without regard to their energy state, which leads to unexpected capacity saturation. By accounting for the energy states of VPPs, model-predictive control (MPC) can optimally dispatch conventional generators and VPPs to overcome disturbances while avoiding undesired capacity saturation. The results show the improvement in dynamics by using MPC over conventional AGC and droop for a system with energy-constrained resources. © 2019 IEEE.},

It allows, on the one hand, to substitute traditional heating technologies with highly-efficient heat pumps (HPs), while, on the other hand, exploiting cost-effective thermal storage options (TES) such as hot water tanks, ultimately increasing system flexibility and renewables penetration. Nonetheless, an accurate assessment of the benefits that may be ensured by a country-wide diffusion of P2H technologies is hindered by computational difficulties in representing large numbers of distributed HPs and TES systems within regionalor country-scale energy models. In this work, we simulate large numbers of individual HPs and TES systems and compute the realistic aggregate electricity consumption associated with those. Various relevant regulation logics are simulated, either thermostatically-controlled or aggregator-controlled. For the latter, we show that an equivalent virtual power plant (VPP) representation ensures sufficient accuracy for use in largescale energy models (NRMSE<10%). Finally, we evaluate the flexibility potential ensured by the different P2H configurations considered, by incorporating those into an open energy system optimisation model. We show that flexibility and decarbonisation benefits are achieved in all configurations, although they increase (up to -89.5 GWh/week of primary energy savings) with the degree of 'smartness' and PV-friendliness of P2H operation logics. © ECOS 2020.All right reserved.},

These technologies are typically small-scaled, dispersed and connected to distribution systems. Dispersed generation units, storage systems, electric vehicles, and controllable loads may be capable of providing flexible power. Coordinated dynamic use of flexible power from large numbers of small units could become a key contribution to cope with grid congestion in the future. The paper presents a methodology to determine the maximum, time-variant potential for redispatch of distributed units aggregated in a virtual power plant. It is based on parameter-based optimization and takes into account dynamic and energy capacity related constraints. Moreover, the constraints of distribution and transmission systems as well as the impact on power flows is considered and investigated for multiple scenarios by using linearized power flow sensitivities.

	abstract = {Distributed energy resources are an ideal candidate for the provision of additional flexibility required by the power system to support the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. The integrating large number of resources in the existing market structure, particularly in the light of providing flexibility services, is envisioned through the concept of virtual power plant (VPP). To this end, it is crucial to establish a clear methodology for VPP flexibility modelling. In this context, this paper first puts forward the need to clarify the difference between feasibility and flexibility potential of a VPP, and then propose a methodology for the evaluation of relevant operating regions. Similar concepts can also be used to modelling TSO/DSO interface operation. Several case studies are designed to reflect the distinct information conveyed by feasibility and flexibility operating regions in the presence of 'slow' and 'fast' responding resources for a VPP partaking in the provision of energy and grid support services. The results also highlight the impact of flexible load and importantly network topology on the VPP feasibility (FOR) and flexibility (FXOR) operating regions. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Additional flexibility to accommodate the increasing share of intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is essential to guarantee reliable and stable operation of low-carbon power systems. The concept of virtual power plant (VPP) is central to the aggregation and coordinated control of heterogeneous Distributed Energy Resources (DER), as VPPs can offer aggregated DER capacity in various markets for the provision of energy and grid support services. Among emerging technologies, electrolyzers for hydrogen production could provide system support services and thus be integrated in a VPP framework as an additional source of flexibility. To do so, this paper first introduces, for PEM and alkaline electrolyzer technologies, their active and reactive (P-Q) power 'feasibility charts' based on their underlying physical characteristics. These are then used within a broader VPP-based DER aggregation setup to describe its P-Q capability chart, also referred to as feasible operating envelope (FOE), while also considering relevant distribution network constraints, and studying the impact of electrolyzer location and operation on voltage profiles. Simulation results show how integrating electrolyzers into VPP schemes could potentially greatly expand their FOE, thereby opening up new opportunities for distributed hydrogen technologies to actively provide operational flexibility at scale.  © 2020 University of Tasmania.},

	abstract = {Growing trends in the deployment of inverter-based renewable energy will decrease the inertia and frequency control capability of electric power systems by replacing conventional power plants; thus, the frequency of future power systems might be dynamic. This study proposes a capability-coordinated frequency control (CCFC) scheme of a virtual power plant (VPP) including adjustable-speed pumped storage hydropower (AS-PSH), a wind power plant (WPP), and an energy storage system to support the frequency nadir and reduce the steady-state error of system frequency. The CCFC scheme is based on a hierarchical-control structure in which a CCFC organises the output of local frequency control units. To support the frequency nadir, the CCFC dispatches weighted frequency errors that are proportional to the available headroom of the units; thus, the errors are forwarded separately with a system frequency error to the primary control loop of each unit and thereby arrest the frequency nadir at a higher value than a system without the CCFC. To reduce the steady-state error of the system frequency, the CCFC determines a partial active power command by additionally feeding an integrator of the CCFC with a modified frequency error that depends on the unit with the largest control. © 2019 IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution.

This study presents a novel approach for determining the optimal offering strategy of a VPP participating in the day-ahead (DA), the spinning reserve (SR), and the real-time (RT) markets. To hedge against multi-stage uncertainties, the authors propose a robust mixed integer linear programming optimisation model that comprises four levels: (i) the optimal DA energy and reserve dispatch; (ii) the worst-case realisation of uncertainties involved in DA market energy prices, SR market capacity prices, stochastic power production, and called balancing power; (iii) the optimal RT energy re-dispatch; and (iv) the worst-case realisation of uncertain RT market energy prices. Moreover, a tractable solution method based on strong duality theory and the column-and-constraint generation algorithm to solve the proposed four-level formulation was developed. Finally, numerical results for a realistic case study demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed approach. The commercial benefits of this strategy are also evaluated. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

It contributes to the stabilization of the power grid by controlling energy consumption and generation at strategic times. Industrial manufacturers can offer their load flexibility at DR markets by cooperating with DR aggregators. They pool and manage many technical units that can provide such flexibility in a virtual power plant (VPP). Many studies promote the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) for the management of these VPPs, however, they are not widely used yet. To enable DR aggregators to use MAS, this paper describes the requirements for the use of MAS technology for a German DR market use case.

To encourage operators (and traders) of renewable generation facilities to enter the market, this paper presents a bidding strategy based on an optimization approach for deriving an optimal bid and for estimating the revenue potential on this market. The focus is on the participation of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) either in standalone mode or in conjunction with a virtual power plant (VPP). An in-depth cost breakdown and battery ageing model support the derivation of earning potentials. With current costs of containerized BESS, an operation is not economically viable. However, with a predicted cost breakdown for the year 2025 and a pooled operation, profits can be generated.

	abstract = {This paper presents a temporally coupled distributed online (TDO) algorithm to aggregate and coordinate numerous networked distributed energy resources (DERs) as a virtual power plant (VPP). A centralized stochastic optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term social utility loss while satisfying the voltage security, operational requirements of DERs, and VPP service requests. After that, we propose the TDO algorithm to reformulate the primary problem as an adaptation of online convex optimization (OCO). In particular, the temporally coupled constraints are well separated to each timeslot. In real-time operation, the VPP operator updates the incentives according to the measurement feedback. The smart energy gateways (SEGs) equipped at each node maximize their income and utility based on the received incentive signals through adjusting the setpoints of the governed photovoltaics (PV) inverters and electric vehicles (EVs). Unlike conventional distributed optimization algorithms where complicated iterative procedures between agents are unavoidable, the proposed TDO algorithm is computation- and communication-efficient since the SEG can directly employ the closed-form optimal setpoints without iterative communications once receiving the incentives. Furthermore, we design an incentive scheme to coordinate the SEGs based on the privacy protected nonintrusive measurements instead of direct control. Optimality and convergency of TDO are analyzed mathematically. Finally, the proposed method is corroborated numerically on a modified 33-node test feeder. A larger system is tested to validate the computational time performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Thermal power generation technologies are widely used for electricity production, for heat provision in district or process heating systems, and for combined heat and power generation. In most cases, thermal technologies are heat driven and electricity is produced as a by-product, thus resulting in a non-flexible behaviour of the electricity production. Modern power grids are characterised by an increasing share of renewable leading to a need for enhanced and flexible ways of controlling the power flow. To provide services to the power grid, thermal generating technologies may be used in a more efficient way, coupled to gas and heat storage systems or aggregated in virtual power plants. Several technical factors determine which technologies are suitable for flexibility provision, including power ranges, start up times and ramp rates. In this work, carried out in the frame of the MAGNITUDE H2020 project, the technical characteristics of thermal sector-coupling technologies were analysed using data from the seven real-life project's case studies. The technical suitability was determined based on the product requirements in selected European power markets for the provision of identified system services.

This warrants both, day-ahead planning of larger schedules for power plants, as well as short-term contracting to counter forecast deviations or to accommodate dynamics of the intra-day markets. In addition, the geographic distribution of renewable energy sources forces scheduling algorithms with a hugely different communication link qualities. In this paper, we present an extension to the Lightweight Power Exchange Protocol (LPEP), dubbed LPEP++. It draws on the strength of the LPEP to find the optimal solution of the combinatorial power demand-supply problem with string guarantees in acceptable time and extends it with facilities for long-term planning, parallel negotiations and reduces its memory footprint. We furthermore show its robustness towards volatile communication link quality. © 2020 IEEE.},

The great potential of flexible loads from demand response (DR) can be seen as a cost-effective option to handle such issues. In this regard, this study investigates the operation of a virtual power plant (VPP) that is constructed by a DR aggregator and wind power aggregator to handle the inherent volatility of wind generators as well as the possible wind power outage. A stochastic programming formulation in three stages is offered for the VPP that participates in the balancing, intraday and day-ahead markets. The model for DR is developed based on the elasticity concept, and the scenarios related to severe outages of the wind generators are considered. In order to manage the risk of the problem, conditional value-at-risk has also been employed in offering strategy. Case studies demonstrate that the VPP offering strategy can efficiently solve the balancing problem as well as outage risk of the wind generation while increasing the net profit in case of joint operation. © 2020 IET.

Multi-horizon information-gap decision theory (MH-IGDT) as a non-deterministic and non-probabilistic uncertainty modeling framework is proposed here to specifically model the uncertainty sources considering their various uncertainty horizons. Since each uncertain parameter tends to optimize its uncertainty horizon competitively for a particular value of the uncertainty budget, the proposed MH-IGDT model is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this multi-objective problem, enhanced normalized normal constraint (ENNC) method is presented, which can obtain efficient uniformly-distributed Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed ENNC includes augmented normalized normal constraint method and lexicographic optimization technique to enhance the search performance in the objective space. To address the unsolved issue of being risk-averse or risk-seeker for a VPP in the market, a bi-directional decision-making approach is presented. This decision maker comprises an ex-ante performance evaluation method and a forward-backward dynamic programming approach to hourly find the best Pareto solution within the generated risk-averse and risk-seeker Pareto frontiers. Simulation results of the proposed self-scheduling strategy are presented for a VPP including dispatchable/non-dispatchable units, storages, and loads.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

The VPP comprises several dispatchable generation units, battery energy storage systems (BESSs), wind power units, and flexible loads. The proposed scheduling framework is formulated as a risk-constrained stochastic program to maximize the VPP's profit considering uncertainties of loads, wind energy and electricity prices as well as N-1 contingencies. The proposed model considers both supply and demand-sides capability for providing and deploying reserves in order to optimize the use of resources while satisfying N-1 security and other constraints. Moreover, the effect of risk-aversion on decision making of the VPP in the offering/bidding power and required reserve services is investigated by implementing conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in the optimization model. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test VPP and the energy and reserve scheduling with and without DR participants is addressed in detail through a numerical study. Moreover, the effects of the operator's risk-averse behavior on the VPP energy and reserve management and its security indices are investigated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Residential electricity generation, e.g., through photovoltaic panels, plays a fundamental role in this paradigm, where users are able to participate in an energy sharing system and exchange energy resources among each other. In this work, we study energy sharing systems and, differently from previous approaches, we consider realistic user behaviors by taking into account the user preferences and level of engagement in the energy trades. We formulate the problem of matching energy resources while contemplating the user behavior as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, and show that the problem is NPHard. Since the solution of such problem requires the knowledge of the user behavioral model, we propose an heuristic based on reinforcement learning with bounded regret to learn such model while optimizing the system performance. Comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches using realistic simulations based on real traces shows that our method outperforms existing schemes in several efficiency metrics. Besides, the results reveal that increasing the amount of produced energy improves the learning ability of the system even in a short period. It gives practical insights for implementation of energy sharing systems. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is recognized as an effective option to aggregate and operate Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to participate in wholesale energy markets and provide flexibility and associated grid services that are needed in a renewable-rich energy system. Also, as most of the DER are available in urban areas, there are increasing interests in assessing the potential to develop urban VPP, for example in university campuses. However, exploiting the flexibility of VPP and developing robust business cases require advanced considerations on their technical and commercial constraints and trade-offs in deploying the VPP's flexibility when simultaneously participating in multiple markets. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive, integrated techno-economic modeling approach that assesses the technical and commercial flexibility opportunities and develops a relevant business case framework based on co-optimized participation in multiple markets for an urban VPP. A real-world case study based on the University of Melbourne's new campus under development is used to demonstrate the proposed approach, including the VPP's participation in the energy, frequency control ancillary services, demand response, and hedging contract markets. The technical analysis shows that diversity of DER portfolio results in improved participation of VPP in various markets. From an economic perspective, a multi-market co-optimization model such as the one proposed here, fully exploiting the DER's aggregated flexibility, results in attractive business cases for operating DER in urban areas as a VPP. The proposed approach and examples provided may be seen as a blueprint for more VPP applications and unlocking the great flexibility available in urban areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose and analyze a community-driven platform for flexibility provision based on a distributed ledger. We introduce and analyze the platform for the use case of a self-organized decentralized virtual power plant consisting of a local community of individual prosumers with photovoltaic-storages located on a low voltage feeder. Like a virtual power plant, it aggregates small-scale assets and is able to provide ancillary services in the form of active power provision to the electrical power system. However, the decentralized virtual power plant provides a direct flexibility market access of the distributed assets without the need for a third party. Thus, balancing group managers or system operators can directly interact with the distributed assets in an aggregated way without the need for an aggregator. The solution approach uses a heuristic algorithm for the coordination combined with a distributed ledger and democratic consensus within the community. We propose the concept in detail, describe the prototypical implementation based on a consortium Ethereum blockchain and discuss results of the proof-of-concept. Our numerous test runs with up to 20 participants showed that the coordinated flexibility provision, energy sharing and according financial settlement works in practice, but would need an upgrade concerning the smart-meter hardware for an implementation in the field. We analyze the impact of the coordination interval on the community self-sufficiency and determine that one minute intervals are enough to reach 96% of the optimum. We evaluate the storage and communication effort and conclude with suggestions for future improvements and other possible applications of the decentralized platform like aggregated flexibility coordination between balancing group managers and system operators. © 2019, The Author(s).},

In this study, we develop several optimization and forecasting methods, and apply them to model the operation of multiple renewable generators across Scotland, trading energy as a single CVPP. The aim of the techniques developed is to optimize the scheduling of the CVPP, such as to maximize revenues and reduce the penalties resulting from forecasting errors, while considering operational and market constraints, such as variable costs, ramping rates, start-up costs, day-ahead and imbalance prices. The practical application is based on a case study of operational renewable energy plants in Scotland, and optimizes the CVPP operation for 3 months in winter and summer of 2017, respectively. Renewable generation output, day-ahead prices and imbalance prices are obtained from historical data for the same year. The numerical results show a profit increase of around 12% for the CVPP compared to standalone operation of renewable plants. This increase is observed for different market and imbalance settlement strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The VPP markets electricity produced in the wind parks it manages on the day-ahead market and on six staggered auction-based intraday markets. Uncertainty enters the problem via stochastic electricity prices as well as uncertain wind energy production. We set up the problem of bidding for one day of operation as a Markov decision process (MDP) that is solved using a variant of the stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm. We conduct an extensive out-of-sample comparison demonstrating that the optimal policy obtained by the stochastic program clearly outperforms deterministic planning, a pure day-ahead strategy, a benchmark that only uses the day-ahead market and the first intraday market, as well as a proprietary stochastic programming approach developed in the industry. Furthermore, we study the effect of risk aversion as modeled by the nested Conditional Value-at-Risk as well as the impact of changes in various problem parameters. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals. Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that. In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem. © 2019 ACM.},

Compared with existing literature that only position the VPP as a commercial unit, GraphVPP considers both the economic operation of distributed energy resources (DERs) within the VPP and their technical impacts towards the network security of transmission and distribution systems. First, GraphVPP stores the power grid data and market information in a graph structure, and then formulates a two-stage optimization problem for deriving the market clearing results including local marginal prices (LMPs) and generation dispatches. To ensure the power grid's stability under the scheduled generation dispatches, a graph based power flow algorithm is introduced for the network security analysis. Once the network security check is approved, a profit-maximization bidding decision model is introduced for each VPP to derive the optimal bidding strategy. Finally, case study compares different types of VPPs within the wholesale electricity market to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed GraphVPP.  © 2020 IEEE.},

The P2P energy trading is the recent trend the power society is keen to adopt carrying out several trial projects as it eases to generate and share the renewable energy sources in a distributed manner inside local community. Blockchain and smart contracts are the up-and-coming phenomena in the scene of the information technology used to be considered as the cutting-edge research topics in power systems. Earlier works on P2P energy trading including and excluding blockchain technology were focused mainly on the optimization algorithm, Information and Communication Technology, and Internet of Things. Therefore, the financial aspects of P2P trading in a VPP framework is focused and in that regard a P2P energy trading mechanism and bidding platform are developed. The proposed scheme is based on public blockchain network and auction is operated by smart contract addressing both cost and security concerns. The smart contract implementation and execution in a VPP framework including bidding, withdrawal, and control modules developments are the salient feature of this work. The proposed architecture is validated using realistic data with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment of Ropsten Test Network.

Many plaiming and scheduling problems are of a multi-objective nature. For the single-objective case - e.g. predictive scheduling with the goal of jointly resembling a wanted target schedule -fully decentralized algorithms with self-organizing agents exist. We extend this paradigm towards fully decentralized agent-based multi-objective scheduling for energy resources e.g. in virtual power plants for which special local constraint-handling techniques are needed. We integrate algorithmic elements from the well-known S-metric selection evolutionary multi-objective algorithm into a gossiping-based combinatorial optimization heuristic that works with agents for the single-objective case and derive a number of challenges that have to be solved for fully decentralized multi-objective optimization. We present a first solution approach based on the combinatorial optimization heuristics for agents and demonstrate viability and applicability in several simulation scenarios. © 2019 Polish Information Processing Society - as since.},

The virtual power plant (VPP) enables DERs to provide their valuable services by aggregating them and participating in the wholesale market as a single entity. However, the available capacity of VPP depends on its DER outputs, which is time varying and not exactly known when the independent system operator runs the day-ahead unit commitment engine. In this study, we develop a model to evaluate the physical characteristics of the VPP, i.e., its maximum capacity and ramping capabilities, given the uncertainty in wind power output and load consumption. The proposed model is based on a distributionally robust optimization approach that utilizes moment information (e.g., mean and covariance) of the unknown parameter. We reformulate the model as a binary second-order conic program and develop a separation framework to address it. We first solve a two-stage problem and then benchmark it with a multi-stage case. Case studies are conducted to show the performance of the proposed approach. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The penetrations of high efficiency technologies and photovoltaic (PV) generation are increasing in the residential sector. Technologies such as improved insulation and efficient HVAC systems significantly affect the energy profile of a house. This effect varies due to climate characteristics, i.e. temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speeds. The effect of other technologies, such as efficient water heaters, lighting, or kitchen appliances, is mainly governed by human behavior, which may be represented by a schedule. This paper studies the performance of both climate-influenced and scheduled household devices among different levels of efficiency through combined computational and experimental methods. Three houses were constructed by the Tennessee Valley Authority and were outfitted with robots that mimicked the occupation of a family. The houses represented three categories of residences, namely, typical builder, retrofit, and near net-zero-energy. With the energy and weather data collected from 2009 to 2014, a total of four house energy models were developed to account for equipment changes throughout the years. The studies performed using these models considered the behavior of the HVAC systems, PV system, and water heaters as well as climate effects. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Achieving the renewable energy integration target will require the extensive engagement of consumers and the private sector in investment and operation of renewable-based energy systems. Virtual power plants are an efficient way to implement this engagement. In this paper, the detailed costs and benefits of implementing a realistic virtual power plant (VPP) in Western Australia, comprising 67 dwellings, are calculated. The VPP is designed to integrate and coordinate rooftop solar photovoltaic panels (PV), vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), heat pump hot water systems (HWSs), and demand management mechanisms. An 810-kW rooftop solar PV system is designed and located using the HelioScope software. The charging and the discharging of a 700-kWh VRFB are scheduled for everyday use over a year using an optimization algorithm, to maximize the benefit of it for the VPP owners and for the residents. The use of heat pump HWSs provides a unique opportunity for the residents to save energy and reduce the total cost of electricity along with demand management on some appliances. The cost-and-benefit analysis shows that the cost of energy will be reduced by 24% per dwelling in the context of the VPP. Moreover, the internal rate of return for the VPP owner is at least 11% with a payback period of about 8.5 years, which is a promising financial outcome. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The concept of a virtual power plant (VPP) was introduced for supporting market participation of small-scale renewable energy-based generators (REGs). In a VPP, energy storage systems (ESSs) and micro-turbine-based generators (MTGs) are used together to mitigate the variability of the output of REGs. To keep the output of a VPP at the contracted value in a market, centralized feeder flow control (FFC) methods can be adopted for the VPP. However, conventional centralized FFC methods lack careful consideration of different characteristics of various resources and require high-speed communications and several central control units. Therefore, this paper proposes a new FFC method considering various characteristics of resources and enabling operation with less communication dependency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing the results of the proposed method with those of the conventional method with performance analysis, stability analysis, and simulations with Simulink/MATLAB.  © 2013 IEEE.},

A regression-based prediction methodology was used to predict net load over a rolling 24-hour time horizon, with demonstrated accuracy of 8 to 12% root mean square error; net load predictions were ingested by a simulated-annealing algorithm to generate real-time optimal dispatch schedules for system assets given user-defined objectives. Multiple objective functions were tested in combination, including peak shaving, energy cost optimization, peak-power dispatch, and power firming. Field test results show that integrating time-series load and solar predictions and flexible loads into dispatch decisions effectively increased storage capacity relative to a non-predictive baseline by upwards of 20%. Results further highlight the need to manage prediction uncertainty, for example by maintaining sufficient BESS reserve capacity. © 2020 IEEE.},

Toward managing the intermittent nature of DERs, and providing market participation capability, the concept of virtual power plant (VPP) has been developed in the smart grid era. This paper proposes a novel offering strategy method for a VPP consisting of wind power generation along with storage capacity and flexible demand. In the proposed method, two different sources of uncertainty are addressed: stochastic method, applied in dealing with market price uncertainty, and information-gap decision theory (IGDT), incorporated in the offering model counting for wind power production uncertainty. This method enables us to formulate the offering strategy problem as a stochastic IGDT-based optimization. Within the framework of the proposed approach, we explore different operating facets that can affect the solution methodology and how the offering curve is constructed. The theoretical strategy is thoroughly demonstrated and then validated through numerical studies. © 2019, Shiraz University.},

The MGs are connected with the market by distribution networks for the sake of energy balance and to overcome emergency situations. The developed market structure enables the integration of virtual power plants (VPPs) in energy requirement of MGs. The MGs, internal service providers (ISPs), VPPs and distribution network operator (DNO) are present as distinct entities with individual objective of minimum operational cost. Each MG is assumed to be present with a commitment to service its own loads prior to export. Thus an optimisation problem is formulated with the core objective of minimum cost of operation, reduced network loss and least DNO charges. The formulated problem is solved by using heuristic optimization technique of Genetic Algorithm. Case studies are carried out on a distribution system with multiple MGs, ISP and VPPs which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed market optimisation strategy. The key objective of the proposed market model is to coordinate the operation of MGs with the requirements of the market with the help of the DNO, without decreasing the economic efficiency for the MGs nor the distribution network. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.},

	abstract = {The active power dispatching equivalent model of the virtual power plant (VPP) and the global dispatching optimization issue of a regional power system integrated with the VPP equivalent model are studied in this paper. Considering the feasibility of a dispatched active power output curve for VPP, the active power dispatching equivalent model of the VPP is built as two equivalent models. One is the feasibility equivalent model trained by fine trees based on the data sets of the active power output curve of the VPP and its feasibility flag, and the other one is the cost equivalent model trained as a deep neural network based on the data sets of the active power output curve and its daily generation cost. Global dispatching issue is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model and solved by NSGAII algorithm. The active power dispatching equivalent model and the multi-objective optimization model is verified by case study, and results show that the proposed VPP equivalent model makes it possible for the power dispatching center to schedule VPP's optimal power generation plan so as to maximize the generation revenue of the VPP and minimize the total generation cost of the system. © 2019 IEEE.},

In particular, we propose an optimization problem tailored to optimize profits from energy trading in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).

	abstract = {Consensus control has recently been employed to regulate active power output of distributed generators (DGs) of a virtual power plant. However, such networked control systems, integrating information and wireless communication technologies, are subject to cyberattacks. This paper investigates the risk of jamming attacks on the coordination of DGs in a distribution network. A binary-valued stochastic process is employed to model packet losses caused by jamming attacks and nonmalicious communication failures. Using an attack rate to characterize the strategy of an attacker, the proposed method highlights the vulnerability of the cooperative control of DGs subject to cyberattacks. Furthermore, a probabilistic instability analysis provides the conditions under which jamming attacks can prevent active power outputs of DGs from reaching a consensus to track a dispatch command. Accordingly, this paper shows how an attacker might launch malicious attacks to impair consensus-based control of DGs so that energy companies can take precautions. Finally, the theoretical results are verified on the IEEE 34-node test feeder under two different attack strategies. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Common property (CP) is a significant consumer of electricity in apartment buildings. Although some apartments in Australia have adopted shared microgrid configurations to offset grid consumption, the characteristics and load patterns of CP are rarely discussed due to lack of available data. As common areas normally constitute part of owner corporations, energy distribution in these premises requires attention. This paper presents empirical analysis of the CP load connected to shared solar and battery storage for three apartment complexes located in Perth Australia. Load patterns for CP over a defined dataset period were analyzed, and grid usage reduction was examined by implementing and comparing three energy allocation strategies based on surplus energy utilization. The findings indicated significant grid usage reduction for CP load in different apartments after implementation of three strategies. Instantaneous consumption decreased 72%, and surplus allocation strategy reduced 91%, while consumption-based allocation reduced 76%, of grid electricity. Moreover, consumption-based allocation offered improved cost benefits compared to the other two strategies. The results further revealed the usefulness of energy allocation and effectiveness of surplus energy utilization. Based on outcomes, the strategies provide consolidation with conventional energy trading mechanisms and broadly link to the virtual power plant concept for coordinating energy flows between multiple generators. © 2020 by the authors.

In 2018, the building had a peak hourly demand of 48 W/m2 and its electricity consumption (183.2 kWh/m2/yr.) was within low to medium range of air-conditioned UK portfolio. Deferrable loads from heat pumps, air handling units, lifts, lighting, circulating pumps and dry air coolers were used to illustrate building's DR capability over a maximum duration of 4 h per DR cycle. On average, deferrable loads form 46.4% of total building electricity consumption and across a 4-hour DR cycle can be characterised as having an initial power (and stored energies) of 28 kW (401 ± 117 kWh); 109 kW (571±82 kWh); and finally 138 kW (625±18 kWh) for 100%, 41.5% and 24.6% of time respectively. Following a DR event, the HVAC ability to restore original indoor climate was found to be at least twice as fast as climatic drift during the event. A linear regression model was found to be weak in using external temperature to predict the magnitude of aggregated deferrable loads. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To provide continuity of balancing demand and generation, renewable sources will be more active than today in near future due to the tendency of massive investment on renewable energy sources (RESs) by countries. However, due to the uncertain and intermittent nature of RESs, RESs would create problems on power system operations such as power quality, efficiency, stability and reliability. Owing to having problems with RESs integration, virtual power plant (VPP) has introduced to make this integration smooth without compromising the grid stability and reliability along with offering many other techno-economic benefits. This study reviews structures, types, architecture and operations of VPP along with the status of present implementations worldwide. The types of VPP are introduced in details with the optimisation algorithm used with each type. In addition, VPP is linked with the most of the components in power systems such as distributed generation, active prosumers, transmission system operator and distribution system operator, grid services such as fault ride through, reactive power control as well as with the help of technology such as communications, control and optimisations. This study gives a comprehensive outline of transforming microgrid to VPP that is useful for researchers, consumers, prosumers and utility operators. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Virtual power plant (VPP) aggregates heterogeneous distributed energy resources through a cloud-based access control system providing efficient centralized management, visibility and control. Most of the operation strategies for VPPs are designed based on the day-ahead profiles. However, prediction errors of the renewable energy sources and the load demands can lead to a sub-optimal operation in the dispatch scheduling. In this paper, an adaptive and predictive energy management strategy for an online optimal operation of VPPs is proposed based on the model predictive control technique with a feedback correction to compensate for the prediction error. This strategy is divided in to two sections: a) rolling horizon optimization; and b) feedback control based error correction. In the rolling horizon optimization, a hybrid prediction algorithm based on the integration of the time series analysis and the Kalman filters is used to forecast the output powers of the renewable energy sources and the load demands. The rolling horizon optimization model is implemented as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to schedule the operation in accordance with the latest forecast information. The power dispatch schedule is then adjusted based on ultra-short-term error prediction. The feedback control-based error correction is applied to minimize the adjustments for compensating the prediction error and is implemented as a linear program (LP). The proposed strategy is implemented on a VPP in a practical distribution system in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy with better tracking of the actual available resources and a minimal mismatch between demand and supply. © 2020 IEEE.},

Flexibility is defined here as the time period over which plant operation can be either delayed or forced into operation, thus providing upward or downward regulation to the power system on demand. Results for one case study show that a cluster of several smaller heat generation units does not provide much more delayed operation flexibility than one large unit with the same power, while it more than doubles the forced operation flexibility. Considering minimum operational time and minimum down-time of the units considerably limits the available forced and delayed operation flexibility, especially in the case of one large unit. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, centralized energy grid systems are transitioning towards more decentralized systems driven by the need for efficient local integration of new deployed small scale renewable energy sources. The high limits for accessing the energy markets and also for the delivery of ancillary services act as a barrier for small scale prosumers participation forcing the implementation of new cooperative business models at the local level. This paper is proposing a fog computing infrastructure for the local management of energy systems and the creation of coalitions of prosumers able to provide ancillary services to the grid. It features an edge devices layer for energy monitoring of individual prosumers, a fog layer providing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) techniques for managing local energy systems by implementing cooperative models, and a cloud layer where the service specific technical requirements are defined. On top, a model has been defined allowing the dynamical construction of coalitions of prosumers as Virtual Power Plants at the fog layer for the provisioning of frequency restoration reserve services while considering both the prosumers’ local constraints and the service ones as well as the constituents’ profit maximization. Simulation results show our solution effectiveness in selecting the optimal coalition of prosumers to reliably deliver the service meeting the technical constraints while featuring a low time and computation overhead being feasible to be run closer to the edge. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Appropriate control of the electric vehicle (EV) charging and corresponding prices can act as a virtual power plant (VPP) and support distribution system operators (DSOs). When multiple EVs are directly managed or controlled by price, as a cluster they will act as a VPP. This work proposes a price-based VPP with a two-class EV-charging tariff while managing the charging impact on the distribution network. Similar to a generating unit, EVs that participate through a day-ahead schedule will be charged differently than EVs that do not participate in day-ahead scheduling. The objective of this work is to maximise benefits to both the DSO and the consumer. To achieve mutual benefits, in addition to power system constraints, this work incorporates the impact of consumer dissatisfaction due to delayed charging. This is achieved by modelling dissatisfaction as a function of anxiety. This work proposes an unplanned charging unit cost to ensure that both consumer welfare and DSO welfare are jointly accomplished. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the impact of limiting consumer dissatisfaction on the EV-charging load and price for charging. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {The ongoing digitalization of the energy sector opens up opportunities for novel business models which can help to overcome some of the challenges accompanying the sustainable energy transition. One necessity in a more decentralized energy system with high shares of intermittent renewables is the provision of flexibility. This paper empirically applies the business model generation approach of Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) in order to enhance our understanding of these transition challenges. The insights gained indicate that the focus of business models in the electricity supply market has to switch to a customer-driven perspective. To this end, the conceptual business model of an “Energy Supplier 2.0” as a dedicated aggregator of flexible capacities on the household level is investigated, showing how a specific new energy business model can tap the potential of distributed flexible energy assets. We find that the aggregation of the inherent economic potentials of these flexibilities is suitable to provide additional revenue streams, support grid operators, and promote customers to become “prosumers”. Despite these promising advantages, we find in the case of Germany that the current regulation and policies need to be adapted to achieve a broader diffusion of this type of business model and offer suggestions on the implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Distributed solar energy resources (DSERs) in smart grid systems are rapidly increasing due to the steep decline in solar module prices. This DSER penetration has prompted utilities to balance the real-time supply and demand of electricity proactively. A direct consequence of this is virtual power plants (VPPs) that enable solar generated energy trading to mitigate the impact of the intermittent DSERs while also benefiting from distributed generation for more reliable and profitable grid management. However, existing energy trading approaches in residential VPPs do not actually allow DSER users to trade their surplus solar energy independently and concurrently to maximize benefit potential; they typically require a trusted third-party to play the role of an online middleman. Furthermore, due to a lack of fair trading algorithms, these approaches do not necessarily result in "fair"solar energy saving among all the VPP users in the long term. We propose Sola/Trader, a new solar energy trading system that enables unsupervised, distributed, and long term fair solar energy trading in residential VPPs. In essence, SolarTrader leverages a new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach that enables peer-to-peer solar energy trading among different DSERs to ensure that both the DSER users and the VPPs maximize benefit. We implement SolarTrader and evaluate it using both synthetic and real smart meter data from 4 U.S. residential VPP communities that are comprised of ∼229 residential DSERs in total. Our results show that SolarTrader can reduce the aggregated VPP energy consumption by 83.8% when compared against a non-trading approach. Furthermore, SolarTrader achieves a ∼105% average saving in VPP residents' monthly electricity cost. We also find that SolarTrader-enabled VPPs can achieve a fairness of 0.05, as measured by the Gini Coefficient, a level equivalent to that achieved by the fairness-maximizing Round-Robin approach.  © 2020 ACM.},

Patterns of generation and consumption can be derived from collected schedules and from the aggregated information therein.

OPEN provides an extensible platform for developing and testing new smart local energy system management applications, helping to bridge the gap between academic research and industry translation. OPEN combines features for managing smart local energy systems which are not provided together by existing energy management tools, including multi-phase distribution network power flow, energy market modelling, nonlinear energy storage modelling and receding horizon optimisation. The platform is implemented in Python with an object-oriented structure, providing modularity and allowing it to be easily integrated with third-party packages. Case studies are presented, demonstrating how OPEN can be used for a range of smart local energy system applications due to its support of multiple model fidelities for simulation and control. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In the proposed bidding strategy, the energy markets include the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, and the reserve markets include operating, regulation up and regulation down reserve markets. In view of the differences of energy and reserve prices, renewable generations and load demands between buses on the next day, the mobile energy storages can be delivered to different buses for maximizing the VPP's total expected profit considering its risk preference. In the stochastic optimization model for generating the bidding strategies, the uncertain market prices, renewable power productions and load demands are represented via scenarios, and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used as the risk measure to manage the VPP's risks in the worst case scenarios related to a confidence level. Since the VPP may need to manage the risks related to multiple confidence levels, the proposed model maximizes multiple CVaRs with different confidence levels. Finally, case studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed bidding strategy with mobile energy storages and multiple CVaRs. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In Germany and many other countries the energy market has been subject to significant changes. Instead of only a few large-scale producers that serve aggregated consumers, a shift towards regenerative energy sources is taking place. Energy systems are increasingly being made more flexible by decentralised producers and storage facilities, i.e. many consumers are also producers. The aggregation of producers form another type of power plants: a virtual power plant. On the basis of aggregated production and consumption, virtual power plants try to make decisions under the conditions of the electricity market or the grid condition. They are influenced by many different aspects. These include the current feed-in, weather data, or the demands of the consumers. Clearly, a virtual power plant is focusing on developing strategies to influence and optimise these factors. To accomplish this, many data sets can and should be analysed in order to interpret and create forecasts for energy systems. Time series based analytics are therefore of particular interest for virtual power plants. Classifying the different time series according to generators, consumers or customer types simplifies processes. In this way, scalable solutions for forecasts can be found. However, one has to first find the according clusters efficiently. This paper presents a method for determining clusters of time series. Models are adapted and model-based clustered using ARIMA parameters and an individual quality measure. In this way, the analysis of generic time series can be simplified and additional statements can be made with the help of graphical evaluations. To facilitate large scale virtual power plants, the presented clustering workflow is prepared to be applied on big data capable platforms, e.g. time series stored in Apache Cassandra, analysed through an Apache Spark execution framework. The procedure is shown here using the example of the Day-Ahead prices of the electricity market for 2018. © 2019, The Author(s).},

A cross-border connection of two regions on a medium voltage level is modeled. The underlying model is formulated as a Mixed Integer Problem. It comprises the electricity loads of two cities, their respective renewable electricity generation plants, a battery storage and an electrolyzer. Our research assumes that a promising approach to connect the cities is by a switchable cross-border element which represents a virtual power plant that includes a German and a Dutch wind farm located on either side of the border. The single wind turbines can be connected to either the German or the Dutch electricity distribution grid per quarter hour interval via a switch. The German and the Dutch electricity grids are never interconnected directly. In a simple scenario with constant load and additional renewable investments, connecting the two regions via the cross-border element would lead to a 34 % reduction of the annual electricity system cost caused the region. This is the starting point for the development of legal concepts to enable and realize international cross-border medium voltage electricity transfers. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While the concept of aggregating and controlling renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) to provide grid services is not new, increasing policy support of DER market participation has driven research and development in algorithms to pool DERs for economically viable market participation. Sandia National Laboratories recently undertook a 3 year research programme to create the components of a real-world virtual power plant (VPP) that can simultaneously participate in multiple markets. The authors' research extends current state-of-the-art rolling horizon control through the application of stochastic programming with risk aversion at various time resolutions. Their rolling horizon control consists of day-ahead optimisation to produce an hourly aggregate schedule for the VPP operator and sub-hourly optimisation for the real-time dispatch of each VPP subresource. Both optimisation routines leverage a two-stage stochastic programme with risk aversion and integrate the most up-to-date forecasts to generate probabilistic scenarios in real operating time. Their results demonstrate the benefits to the VPP operator of constructing a stochastic solution regardless of the weather. In more extreme weather, applying risk optimisation strategies can dramatically increase the financial viability of the VPP. The methodologies presented here can be further tailored for optimal control of any VPP asset fleet and its operational requirements. © US Government.},

This work proposes a probabilistic model to estimate the aggregated charging demand and available energy storage capacity of EVs while considering its usage, driving style and travel patterns and battery degradation. The proposed model is based on mathematical formulations that suggest definite improvement with the existing models in terms of accurate estimation of EV charging load and its available energy storage capacity.

It helps to stabilize the power grid by controlling energy consumption and generation at strategic times. There are different demand response markets and different ways to gain access to these markets but all have one thing in common: increasing or decreasing the load of the power grid on the consumer side. In order to offer this, demand response providers must be able to offer flexibility in their energy consumption and/or generation, and also technical and market wise. Demand response providers are often accumulated in a virtual power plant and managed by demand response aggregators. These aggregators pool and manage technical units of industrial manufacturers that can provide energy flexibility and establish the connection to the demand response markets. The management of these loads is a complex task with great optimization potential. This distributed system is subject to various technical and organizational requirements, depending on the market the provider supplies. The current technical implementation has open potential for a more automated and flexible structure. The idea for a multi-agent system for virtual power plants of demand response aggregators to combine the different demand response mechanisms, to automate and optimize underlying processes and transforming them into an expandable generic architecture is proposed in this paper. It shows the requirements of the demand response markets in Germany and the implementation via aggregators. The requirements for such a multi-agent system are listed and further considerations for development are made. © 2019 IEEE.},

The mathematical proofs use the theory of asymptotic statistics to derive a parameter risk measure. We use far in-the-money options to derive a confidence level and use it as a prudent present value adjustment when pricing a virtual power plant. Finally, we conduct a present value benchmarking to compare the approach of temperature-driven demand (based on load data) to an ‘implied demand approach’ (demand implied from observable power futures prices). We observe that the implied demand approach can easily capture observed electricity price volatility whereas the estimation against observable load data will lead to a gap, because–amongst others–the interplay of demand and supply is not captured in the data (i.e., unexpected mismatches). © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

There is an industry need for the capability in power system studies to model ternary pumped storage hydropower (T-PSH), a pumped storage technology that offers increased system benefits. This study presents a comprehensive vendor-neutral dynamic model of T-PSH in GE's commercial software positive sequence load flow. A new governor model is developed with detailed gate valve modelling and a shared-penstock function. Specifically, this model is designed to simulate the seamless transition among three operation modes: generation mode, pumping mode, and hydraulic short-circuit mode. The developed T-PSH model has been tested and validated on a 10-bus test system. A comparison study of T-PSH to conventional pumped storage hydropower has also been conducted on the Western interconnection system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.},

	abstract = {In the modern scenario of smart-grids, the concept of virtual power plant (VPP) is undoubtedly a cornerstone for the smooth integration of renewable energy sources into existing energy systems with a high penetration level. A VPP is the aggregation of decentralized medium-scale power sources, including photovoltaic and wind power plants, combined heat and power units, as well as demand-responsive loads and storage systems, with a twofold objective. On one hand, VPP relieves the stability and dispatchability problems on the external smart grid since it can be operated on an individual basis, appearing as a single system on the whole. On the other hand, VPP improves flexibility coming from all the networked units and enable traders to enhance forecasting and trading programs of renewable energies. This paper proposes a novel distributed decentralized prediction method for the management of VPPs. The novelty of the proposed technique is to effectively combine the concepts of neural networks and machine learning with a distributed architecture that is suitable for the aggregation purposes of the VPP. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Net zero energy (NZE) houses purchase zero net metered electricity from the grid over a year. Technical challenges brought forth by NZE homes are related to the intermittent nature of solar generation, and are due to the fact that peak solar generation and load are not coincident. This leads to a large rate of change of load, and in case of high PV penetration communities, often requires the installation of gas power plants to service this variability. This article proposes a hybrid energy storage system including batteries and a variable power electric water heater which enables the NZE homes to behave like dispatchable generators or loads, thereby reducing the rate of change of the net power flow from the house. A co-simulation framework, INSPIRE+D, which enables the dynamic simulation of electricity usage in a community of NZE homes, and their connection to the grid is enabled. The calculated instantaneous electricity usage is validated through experimental data from a field demonstrator in southern Kentucky. It is demonstrated that when the operation of the proposed hybrid energy storage system is coordinated with solar PV generation, the required size and ratings of the battery would be substantially reduced while still maintaining the same functionality. Methodologies for sizing the battery and solar panels are developed. © 2020 IEEE.},

A correct establishment of a VPP will result in reduced electricity costs for the consumers within the VPP. One of the key aspect of VPP's success is the consumer engagement in order to manage their flexibilities effectively. Gamification is an efficient way of learning and engagement, which can efficiently change the behavior of consumers towards participating in programs provided by VPPs for energy cost reduction. In this paper, a gamification-based approach for consumer engagement is proposed and a methodology based on Fogg's behavior model and Kim's model on player types is developed to examine the suitability of available gamification applications for energy saving/efficiency in the context of a VPP. Seven gamification applications are analyzed and evaluated based on the developed methodology and the results are provided. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The expansion of renewable energies and the resulting decentralization of the electricity production poses major challenges for electricity grids. A solution approach for this problem is the creation of self-sufficient (island mode) microgrids. Since the electricity required in such a microgrid is primarily produced and consumed locally (up to 100%), less electricity has to be transported over long distances via cables. However, the goal of keeping the degree of self-sufficiency of a microgrid reliably on a high level turns out to be a difficult task due to various constraints such as the composition of the local electricity production or the additional consideration of electric vehicles. In order to address this problem, this paper presents a two-step optimization methodology which allows to increase the degree of self-sufficiency of a microgrid based on a composition of local power plants, consumers and electric vehicles. To implement the methodology, two Computational Intelligence (CI) metaheuristics are applied and compared: Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). On the basis of an example scenario as well as extensive, aggregated test runs, the results show that the proposed methodology is capable of reliably increasing the degree of self-sufficiency of a microgrid. © VDE VERLAG GMBH.},

	abstract = {The smart grid concept enables demand-side management, including electric vehicles (EVs). Thus way, some ancillary services can be provided in order to improve the power system stability, reliability, and security. The high penetration level of renewable energy resources causes some problems to independent system operators, such as lack of primary reserve and active power balance problems. Nowadays, many countries are encouraging the use of EVs which provide a good chance to utilize them as a virtual power plant (VPP) in order to contribute to frequency event. This paper proposes a new control method to use EV as VPP for providing primary reserve in smart grids. The primary frequency reserve helps the power system operator to intercept the frequency decline and to improve the frequency response of the whole system. The proposed method calculates the electric vehicles' primary reserve based on EVs' information, such as the state of charge (SOC), the arriving time and the vehicle's departure time. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by several simulation scenarios on a real-world modern power system with different generating units, such as conventional power plants, renewable energy resources, and electric vehicles. © 2020 by the authors.},

The falling costs of IoT technology, batteries and solar systems have exposed power conversion costs as a growing part of the total system cost. The proposed PCS is based on an isolated three port converter (TPC) and an inverter stage to facilitate grid connection. The TPC solution seeks to reduce costs by combining several power conversion devices into a single package. Any single-phase conversion system must deal with double line frequency (DLF) power fluctuations. This TPC conversion allows the DLF power components to be selectively directed to any port. The DLF components can be restrained to a filter at the grid connection port or directed to a battery system. It is generally desirable to direct DLF currents away from the PV port. A 3-level square wave modulation method is adopted to control DLF flows in the PCS and to the converters soft switching capability. The simulation model with the proposed control methods for the PCS is developed in Matlab/Simulink. The simulation and experimental results show that the DLF voltage ripple on the dc-link is suppressed. The results also show that the active power of the PV port is free of DLF oscillations. © 2020 IEEE.},

ESSs are the most used instruments in a VPP to adapt the variations of the power demand to the given level of power generation. As the ESSs' investment will significantly affect the economy of VPP construction, this paper proposes a bi-level fuzzy stochastic expectation model (FSEM) to optimize the cost of ESSs in VPPs. At the lower level, a VPP-ESS operation model is constructed for the minimum power fluctuation of photovoltaics and wind turbine in VPPs, and the minimum variance of output power is taken as the objective function considering its uncertainties. At the upper level, the VPP-ESS planning model based on the fuzzy stochastic expectation theory is built in order to minimize the investment and maintenance costs and obtain the optimal capacity and the power rating of ESSs. An optimization algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation, Genetic Algorithm, and Quadratic Programming is further proposed to solve this ESS planning problem. Both the proposed bi-level FSEM and the solution method are verified on a modified IEEE-33 test feeder, and the result analysis demonstrates that the model and the solution are applicable and practical. © 2019 Author(s).},

	abstract = {The energy transition (“Energiewende”) in Germany will result in a substantial transformation of the energy supply system. Virtual power plants are expected to be important components of the new intelligent energy infrastructure. They aggregate beside different types of distributed generation units also active consumers and storage technologies in order to integrate these in a profit-maximising, system-stabilising, and sustainable way. The assessment of the economic performance of virtual power plants requires a scenario-based and model-supported analysis. In this relation, future energy market conditions are simulated using the scenario methodology. Starting from the year 2015, three scenarios have been identified that illustrate alternative energy developments in Germany by 2030. Based on these scenarios, the additional revenues potential of the modeled virtual power plant is identified when compared to an independent and non-market-oriented operation mode of distributed energy resources. According to the model results, revenues of the VPP can increase by 11% up to 30% in the analyzed scenarios in 2030 due to the market-oriented operation mode. Nevertheless, the amount and composition vary depending on technology-specific subsidies, temporary nature of power demand and price structures in the energy market. Fluctuating renewable energies are expected to benefit from the market-oriented operation mode in the virtual power plant, especially through the EEG direct marketing. The selective and regulated shutdown of renewable energies in times of negative electricity prices may lead to further cost savings. The utilization of temporary price fluctuations in the spot market and the demand-oriented provision of control power offer high additional revenue potential for flexible controllable technologies such as battery storage, biomethane as well as combined heat and power units. Finally, the determination of the long-term profitability of a virtual power plant still requires a full-scale cost–benefit analysis. For this holistic approach, the model results provide a reliable scientific basis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {More renewable energy resources have been connected to the grid with the promotion of global energy strategies, which presents new opportunities for the current electricity market. However, the growing integration of renewable energy also brings more challenges, such as power system reliability and the participants' marketable behavior. Thus, how to coordinate integrated renewable resources in the electricity market environment has gained increasing interest. In this paper, a bilevel bidding model for load serving entities (LSEs) considering grid-level energy storage (ES) and virtual power plant (VPP) is established in the day-ahead (DA) market. Then, the model is extended by considering contingencies in the intraday (ID) market. Also, according to the extended bidding model, a remedial strategic rescheduling approach for LSE's daily profit is proposed. It provides a quantitative assessment of LSE's loss reduction based on contingency forecasting, which can be applied to the power system dispatch to help LSEs deal with coming contingencies. Simulation results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we introduce a structured approach to solve the complex interoperability issues of connected systems and sub-systems based on experiences from the healthcare enterprise, where formerly rather closed systems were successfully migrated towards more open system. This approach combines well-established use case methodologies from the software development domain with benefits of the concept of integration profiles which can be found in the healthcare domain. The combination of the two methods is demonstrated by developing an integration profile for an application example from the Smart Grid domain; the virtual power plant operation use case. Using the presented method, a step-by-step guideline for implementers could be created. The profiling methodology seems to be an appropriate method to approach complex interoperability issues of Energy Systems and may be expanded to other fields. © 2017 IEEE.},

It provides a reliable and secure power supply, and covers different load schemes regarding varying electricity prices. The applied methods include building a VPP, and developing a power management system (PMS) for that VPP. The PMS is based on an agent-concept and the optimization algorithms are based on linear programming. Sensitivity analyses of different load schemes are done for different market integration approaches. The results show that electricity from RES, when combined in a VPP, deliver a secure power supply at low costs. It is also shown that the average optimized costs are influenced depending on the share of adjustable components (biogas, battery), time of year and the expected profile. The logical backbone of the PMS-the agent concept-is able to maintain the power supply stably and reliably. The applied Multi Agent Based Optimization Algorithm (MABOA) works reliably; it’s plug-and-play structure allows the implementation of new components and the adoption of the algorithms in the operating system (hot plug), which helps to quickly react to changing requirements (legal, economic, technical) on the system without harming the system stability. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

Contemporary congestion management heavily relies on redispatch of large-scaled conventional power plants. This needs to be reconsidered as the power system develops towards distributed generation and increased importance of flexibility. This paper presents concepts on how virtual power plants (VPP) of aggregators could be incorporated in redispatch procedures. To this end, the technical redispatch potential of VPPs is calculated by an optimization-based methodology. In the context of this paper, a VPP may consist of flexible generators, storage systems, electric mobility and flexible loads. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by applying it to case studies considering different grid structures, VPP combinations and installed power of flexible generation and load. © VDE VERLAG GMBH Â Berlin Â Offenbach},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of large-scale renewables and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) leads to increased uncertainty and reduced controllability of energy generation. Thus, control of demand is becoming more necessary to maintain network energy balancing. Individually these devices are often too small to operate in the electrical markets and operated individually can have negative impact on the local network. One method to address this is by the use of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), which aggregate a diverse set of DR devices with a similar network location to act as a single entity. Integrating different energy vectors into the VPP can both provide additional storage and flexibility to the VPP, but also provide additional revenues. Hydrogen storage is a promising technology that will be considered in this paper for integration with DR. This paper will present the applications of a framework for modelling an electricity-hydrogen VPP that can schedule and dispatch devices providing DR; compete in multiple wholesale markets; and provide local network support. This VPP operates with a 24-hour planning horizon, and a 5minute dispatch. A case study has been conducted on a VPP that contains renewable generation, thermal generation, curtailable load and hydrogen-based devices with hydrogen storage. The results show that the VPP can effectively control the devices providing DR and utilize the hydrogen storage and maximize VPP earnings while providing local network support whilst effectively adapting to price changes. © 2019 IEEE.},

By virtue of aggregating flexible negative and positive generation resources, or 'flex', into a single portfolio and offering it to entities who are customers of 'flex', the VPP needs to offer different value propositions to different customers. For utilities, cities, residential communities, industry parks, or clusters of small medium enterprises, a VPP not only offers grid stability, new revenue sources, and a more sustainable and greener future, it also raises the question: How can different entities come together to foster the VPP concept and realize a common value creation network.

	abstract = {In this paper, an integrated and modular control design is developed for distributed energy resources (DERs) to stabilize power systems and minimize effects of load variations and intermittent generation. Traditionally, the droop control of each generator (or virtual power plant) works as a local feedback loop to track frequency during load disturbance, whereas automatic generation control (AGC) calculates control signals and sends them to each generator with the goal of matching the total generation and load in the overall system. The droop control and the AGC work separately, therefore the two controls often conflict each other. The proposed design enables us to modularly synthesize an integrated control for each of the DERs by using both local and wide-area measurements so that the controls work together in enhancing stability and performance of the power system. The design methodology admits the full nonlinear power flow equations, and it results in a data-driven control that in real-time takes into account the nonlinear power flow interactions (in terms of current angle measurements) and adaptively adjusts parameters of the controls that operate the DERs. The design framework uses the concept of passivity-short systems to analyze individual DERs and quantify their dynamic responses in such a way that the resulting system-wide implementation becomes plug-and-play. Simulations are done to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and design. © 2017 IEEE.},

By characterizing two specific VPP problems, we first give a comprehensive VPP formulation that maximizes the economic benefit subjected to the power balance constraint, line transmission limits and local constraints of all distributed energy resources (DERs). Then, utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers and consensus optimization, a distributed VPP dispatch algorithm is developed for the general VPP problem. In particular, Theorem 1 is derived to show the convergence of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is completely distributed without requiring a centralized controller, and each DER is regarded as an agent by implementing local computation and only communicates information with its neighbors to cooperatively find the globally optimal solution. The algorithm brings some advantages, such as the privacy protection and more scalability than centralized control methods. Furthermore, a new variant of the algorithm is presented for improving the convergence rate. Finally, several case studies are used to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Whilst many papers have been presented showing how virtual power plants could operate, it has been difficult to evaluate and compare their performance with respect to the grid requirements. In this paper, we present a methodology for evaluating VPP performance, and propose a novel performance index called the 'Cumulative Performance Index' CPI, that can be used to evaluate VPPs under various scenarios. The CPI is derived based on grid requirements and VPP operation. In this paper we demonstrate the use of CPI to evaluate the optimization of a VPP under a pricing scheme using different initial battery conditions. The results shows how best grid operation does not necessarily match best prosumer or VPP operator benefit. © 2017 IEEE.},

DERs can provide real and reactive power support to the transmission system through aggregation as virtual power plant (VPP). The challenge is how to control the individual DERs to realize the desired volt and var droop response at the grid supply point (GSP). This paper analyzes the aggregation behavior of droop-controlled DERs on a study system designed to capture the essential attributes of the problem being studied. The simulation result shows that the aggregate droop curve deviates significantly from the ideal droop reference by more than 25% on average and by 230% in the worst case. The deviation tends to deteriorate in heavy loading conditions, and the load model effect on the deviation is found to be less than 1% on average. Notably, the study demonstrates that a given target piece-wise linear droop curve can best be approximated by tuning the individual piece-wise linear droop curves. These conclusions are meaningful in defining GSP performance indices and control targets in the context of DER-dominated VPP. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of innovation ecosystems gained significant importance in academic research on strategy and practice over the last years. The emergence of the Internet of Things is disrupting industries and setting the ecosystem in the focus of innovation. Even traditional analog industries, like the energy industry, are under pressure to foster and manage ecosystems during their innovation efforts. Thus, the energy industry represents an appropriate setting for examining the evolution of an innovation ecosystem under the empirical lens of controversies, which describe the challenges of the status quo and is congruent with previous research on dialectical inquiries as source of innovation dynamics. For the purpose of this paper, the Actor-network theory (ANT) is regarded as an appropriate tool since it allows researchers to analyze how actors interact due to their specific interests with each other and thus configure the ecosystem in its base. ANT further enlarges the perspective of handling actors, while it involves not only human but also non-human actors (i.e. technologies). This is a valuable and necessary feature while dealing with digital innovations such as virtual power plants (VPP). By analyzing three how distinctive typologies, their mechanisms as well as their pathways of controversies affect the innovation ecosystem of VPPs and the evolution of the technological components of the innovation, this interaction between human and non-human actors is highlighted. In consequence, our research emphasizes the significance of involving non-human actors into managerial strategies and the role they inherit for the evolution of ecosystems. Furthermore, the present research reveals that controversies are not only a moderating factor but also a constitutional one for the coevolution of the ecosystem as well as the innovation itself especially during the forming phases. With respect to recent research of the management of digital innovation, this paper contributes to a better understanding of managerial challenges associated with digital innovation and their respective ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The increasing share of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) entails a rising number of congestions in the German distribution grids, such as voltage band violations and overloading of network assets. Consequently the need for grid expansion increases [1]. A politically promoted alternative to grid expansion is managing congestions by the preventive use of flexibility options, such as flexible generation, load management and storage systems [2]. However, preventive congestion management is not yet established in distribution grids. Thus, various measures are under discussion to stimulate the provision of flexibility options by its owners for concerns of congestion management. Assessing the suitability of solutions among these congestion management measures (CMMs) requires a realistic modeling of grid operation, energy system structures and the behavior of the owners of DER and flexibility options. The intended application of the presented simulation framework is consequently the assessment of the macro- and micro-economic effects of preventative CMMs in distribution grids. Supporting that goal, the design of an agent-based simulation framework, which incorporates detailed optimization models for simulating the behavior of grid users (owners of DER and flexibility options) and Distribution System Operators (DSO) is presented. Exemplarily it is applied on a realistic distribution grid use case. The simulation framework enables analyzing the consequences of the grid users’ interaction with the DSO following defined CMMs. Within the framework, the grid users are modeled as individually or market driven oriented users, who both aim at improving their micro-economic situation. The DSO's operational target is the minimization of congestion management costs under application of several CMMs. The exemplary application focuses on four congestion management concepts, such as flexible tariffs and a market-based flexibility provision. The chosen use case comprises a congested distribution grid with high PV penetration and grid users at the medium and low voltage level. In the use case, the alternatively necessary curtailment of renewable energy can be reduced from 15% to 35% depending on the considered CMM. The most promising CMM (a market-based flexibility provision) reduces the DSO's congestion management costs by 33%, without degrading the grid users’ economic situation. Future work will advance the analyses based on a comprehensive database of realistic distribution grid scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rising share of renewable energies presents major challenges in terms of ensuring electrical supply in Germany. Problems are caused by weather-dependent infeed of decentralized generation units. As a solution, different renewable energy sources are pooled in a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). In VPPs, these generation units are coordinated and scheduled in order to reduce deviations from forecasts and therefore allow operation as a conventional power plant. This paper evaluates the technical integration of VPPs into the German power system. The examined VPP is considered in a defined use case and consists of wind, photovoltaic and biomass generation units, enhanced by an energy storage. In order to coordinate systems, the operational concept of following the schedule in intra-day is focused. Therefore, a profit maximized schedule in day-ahead is developed which is to be followed in intra-day under economic aspects using mixed integer linear programming. In particular, benefits of system integration of energy storage in VPPs are presented. Results of case studies indicate a positive use of energy storage to reduce deviations from the schedule due to diverged weather forecasts, which has only small effects on VPP profit. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To increase economic efficiency of distributed energy resources, the political demand for stronger market integration has intensified across European market areas. In contrast to subsidy based, fixed feed-in tariffs, direct marketing is subject to market risks. These risks are caused by forecasting uncertainties of both intermittent generation and spot market prices. The specifics of different European markets can increase or reduce risks. Aggregating DER to a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) helps to comply with market requirements. Additionally, a systematic use of the available trading options by the VPP operator can be used as risk management. The complexity of market frameworks, trading options and generation technologies within a VPP, makes a detailed market scheduling necessary. Therefore, this paper proposes a stochastic scheduling process, which considers both the expected revenue and market risk in the optimization. The method is applied to various European markets and the influence on risks is evaluated. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decentralized photovoltaic (PV) battery systems have recently received great attention from consumers around the world. PV battery systems allow consumers to reduce their dependence on the local electricity supplier at lower or equivalent costs. However, the profitability of PV battery systems depends greatly on the local meteorological conditions and the local electricity retail tariff. In central European countries, PV battery systems generate and store less electricity in winter months due to lower irradiation. The battery, in particular, can be reserved to provide ancillary services during winter months and thereby improves the overall systems economics. In this study, a large dataset consisting of individual load profiles is used to simulate a virtual power plant which provides ancillary services during battery idle times. The results show that participants with large batteries can greatly increase their overall systems economics by participating in reserve markets. However, participants with small battery capacities may not be able to recover the additional costs for communication with the virtual power plant and are thus not suitable candidates to provide grid stabilizing services (ancillary services). © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To close the gap between wholesale and retail markets, this paper presents a two-stage optimal scheduling model for distributed energy resources (DERs) in the form of a virtual power plant (VPP) participating in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets. In the first stage, the hourly scheduling strategy of the VPP is optimized, in order to maximize the total profit in the DA market. In the second stage, the outputs of the VPP are optimally adjusted, in order to minimize the imbalance cost in the RT market. The conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) is used to assess the risk of profit variability due to the presence of uncertainties in renewable energy outputs, market prices and energy demands. The formulated two-stage models are solved by an enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and the commercial solver AMPL/IPOPT 3.8.0. In the procedures of the enhanced PSO, two particles with the lowest and highest fitness values are used as the starting points, and then the interior point method will be employed to quickly locate local optima. The population size is set at 200, and the iteration number is set at 1000. Simulation results show that coordinated scheduling can effectively offset the renewable energy fluctuation and mitigate the impacts of uncertainties. With the two-level scheduling, the risk exposure can be mitigated, and the cost related to the risk aversion is also effectively reduced. The paper finds that coordinated two-level DERs scheduling is a flexible risk-hedging tool that can identify optimal operation, resulting in more affordable electricity prices for end users. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

	abstract = {Green energy supply can play an important role for manufacturing companies. To achieve this, companies can support their energy supply with renewable energies (RE). For designing and planning a Virtual Power Plant, the PREmdeK simulation can be used. Realized with the AnyLogic software, PREmdeK 3.0 simulates combinations of RE sources, energy storages and consumers as a multiagent system (MAS). In this MAS, every member of the local energy system is represented by an agent. The agents negotiate to reach a balanced energy state. The negotiation is based on operating data (energy production and/or demand) and sustainability criteria. The simulation is set up in a generic way, able to reflect changes in the constellation of the energy system. New agents can easily be implemented into the generic MAS through inheritance. In this paper, the implementation of this MAS to handle energy balancing of local energy system including sector coupling is presented. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Power generation from these renewable sources of electricity is inherently uncertain and, consequently, revenue is random, which induces a risk for the owner. In this study, we investigate to what extent pooling different technologies and locations in the portfolio of a virtual power plant can reduce aggregate risk. To this end, we develop stochastic models for factors driving the assets’ underlying market and volume risks on which we base a model for risk-optimized pooling. Using the German market as an example, we demonstrate that optimal portfolios have a clearly better risk/return profile than the market portfolio.

This system also provides time-of-use pricing to customers. Unlike previous studies, this study attempts to examine how to optimize the allocation of electric energy and to improve the equilibrium of the load curve. Accordingly, we propose a concept of load equilibrium entropy to quantify the overall equilibrium of the load curve and reflect the allocation optimization of electric energy. Based on this entropy, we built a novel multi-objective optimal dispatching model to minimize the operational cost and maximize the load curve equilibrium. To aggregate TCLs into the optimization objective, we introduced the concept of a virtual power plant (VPP) and proposed a calculation method for VPP operating characteristics based on the equivalent thermal parameter model and the state-queue control method. The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm was employed to solve the optimization problems. The simulation results illustrated that the proposed dispatching model can achieve cost reductions of system operations, peak load curtailment, and efficiency improvements, and also verified that the load equilibrium entropy can be used as a novel index of load characteristics. © 2017 by the authors.

Compared to classical VPP architectures, which aim to aggregate several DERs dispersed throughout the electrical grid, in the proposed VPP architecture the supervised physical domain is limited to single users, i.e., to single Points of Delivery (PODs) of the distribution network. The VPP architecture is based on a service-oriented approach, where multiple agents cooperate to implement the optimal management of the prosumer's assets, by also considering different forms of Demand Response (DR) requests. The considered DR schemes range from Price-Based DRs to Event-Based DRs, covering both the normal operating functions and the emergency control requests applied in modern distribution networks. With respect to centralized approaches, in this study the control perspective is moved from the system level to the single prosumer's level, who is allowed to independently provide flexible power profiles through the aggregation of multiple DERs. A generalized optimization model, formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, is also introduced. Such a model is able to compute the optimal scheduling of a prosumer's assets by considering both DR requests and end-users' requirements in terms of comfort levels while minimizing the costs. © 2018 by the authors.},

The increasing penetration of distributed variable generators challenges grid reliability. Wind and photovoltaic power plants are technically able to provide ancillary services, but their stochastic behavior currently impedes their integration into reserve mechanisms. A methodology is developed to forecast the flexibility that a wind-photovoltaic aggregate can provide. A bivariate Kernel Density Estimator forecasts the probability to provide reserve. The methodology is tested on a case study where volumes of automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) are forecasted on a day-ahead horizon. It is found that the wind-photovoltaic aggregate can dedicate a limited share of its forecast production to aFRR. The frequency of insufficient reserve capacity is assessed, by comparing the capacities offered with the measured production. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Increased utilization of residential and small commercial distributed energy resources (DERs) has led DER aggregators to develop concepts such as the virtual power plants (VPP). VPPs aggregate the energy resources and dispatch them akin to a conventional power plant or grid-scale battery to provide flexibility to the system operator. Since the level of flexibility from aggregated DERs is uncertain and time varying, the VPPs' dispatch can be challenging. To improve the system operation, flexible VPPs can be formulated probabilistically and can be realized with chance-constrained model predictive control (CCMPC). This can be solved using scenario-based methodology, which provides a-priori probabilistic guarantees on constraint satisfaction. This paper focuses on understanding the robustness and performance trade offs in receding horizon control with uncertain energy resources. The CCMPC dispatches robustly the uncertain VPPs and conventional generators while taking into account economically optimal, secure reference trajectory for generating assets. Closed-loop performance is with respect to minimizing the deviation of conventional generators from their reference trajectory. To evaluate the trade off between robustness and system performance with uncertain energy resources, a simulation-based analysis is carried out on the modified IEEE 30-bus system. © 2018 Power Systems Computation Conference.},

	abstract = {In Germany, the ongoing expansion of decentral renewable energy sources (RES) is decreasing the full load hours of traditional power plants and consequently their profitability. In the medium and long-term this could result in a crowding out of conventional, regionally concentrated power plants. This poses increasing substantial challenges to a reliable operation of power systems. Due to the ambitious targets of the Federal Government's energy concept, the energy transition has proceeded far in Germany. Advances in information and communications technology (ICT) allow to agregate and to market distributed RES by forming virtual power plants (VPPs). In this paper, we study a grid load data set providing circuit level load time series. Based on the data set, we develop a direct current load ñow (DCLF) model of a control area region of the German transmission grid. To approximate real world congestion incidents, we develop a regressive nodal load model with the ability to reproduce the measured data. Consequentially, we study how flexibility of production of biomass powered plants aggregated to VPPs can be utilized to relax stress on the transmission grid. We show that biomass power plants can contribute to reduce grid load significantly. © 2017 IEEE.},

Beside electricity, the VPP provides required RSs according to the probability of delivery request in the electricity market. A new model for providing RS is introduced in which the dispatchable generation units are financially compensated with their readiness declarations and will be charged/paid for their real-time down/up regulations. Besides, the VPP sets up incentive price-quantity curves to benefit from the potential of demand side management in both energy and RS market. Within the model presented here, the VPP consists of two types of generation units: wind turbine and standby diesel generator; the latter is modeled by considering CO                             2                             -emission penalty costs. The given uncertainties are divided into two parts. Firstly, the uncertainties from the energy market price are simulated using information gap decision theory to evaluate the risk-based resource scheduling for both risk-taker and risk-averse VPP. Other uncertainties affecting decision making such as wind turbine generation, load, regulation up/down calling probabilities, and regulation market prices are modeled via scenario trees. Three typical case studies are implemented to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheduling approach.                          © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The study suggests that the efficiency of power supply with conventional power plants increases by substituting pumped-storage hydro power plants with a virtual battery storage, which is pointed out by decreasing operation of conventional power plants, costs and CO2 emissions. Additionally, the paper shows a conflict between efficient storages and gas power plants, since batteries allow to store cheap power from base load power plants with high CO2 emissions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

This leads to a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) which can be solved through the multiobjective immune algorithm (MOIA). Therefore, the energy market scheduling problem considering low carbon smart grid environment can be analysed. The case studies are conducted to demonstrate the proposed model and present the allocation of power generations as well as the daily energy market scheduling results. It has been proved that the penetration of SG contributes to the mitigation of carbon emissions during the peak demand time by around 500 ton/h. It is also suggested that if the policy maker can provide appropriate monetary compensation for the deployment of SG technologies, generators will be encouraged to participate in the SG deployment. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed energy resources installed in the residential areas enable energy consumers to participate in the demand response of distribution systems. In the literature, the algorithms used for the decision-making process of an energy consumer are often centralized and require a dedicated communication link with the power utility. In this paper, a novel decision-making algorithm known as the auction decision process has been proposed. It helps energy consumers to independently meet the demand response in a decentralized manner. The resultant demand response operates in a distributed manner, where the limited information is transmitted among the neighboring consumers using the short-range ZigBee communication. This minimizes the required initial bulk investment for a power utility compared to using a centralized communication system. The data privacy is also improved when compared to the centralized approach. For this work, finding a path with the least transmission loss is selected as the desired constraint for the decision-making process of the demand response. The proposed method has been demonstrated using the IEEE 33 bus systems. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over a year, net zero energy (NZE) houses produce and feed zero net metered electrical energy to the grid. Technical challenges, notably the 'duck curve' arise due to the fact that peak solar generation and load demand are seldom coincident. Common approaches to mitigate this limitation include the curtailment of solar power, and the use of storage. Surplus solar energy may be stored in a battery, which can subsequently be discharged to supply the home electricity needs when demand is in excess. In addition to batteries, less expensive electric water heaters, which are ubiquitous, can be modified as energy storage systems, functioning as 'uni-directional batteries' by virtue of their high thermal mass. This paper proposes the use of a hybrid energy storage system including both batteries and variable power electric water heaters in NZE residences. It is demonstrated that the hybrid energy storage system along with solar PV generation coordinated and virtual power plant (VPP) controls would reduce the required battery size and ratings while still harvesting the maximum solar energy potential. The proposed control strategy enables the NZE homes to produce dispatchable power or behave like controllable loads, and benefits at the utility level are demonstrated by interconnection of NZE homes with an IEEE 13 node test feeder system. The technology has the potential to mitigate all issues related to solar power variability. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to an imminent fossil energy crisis and environmental pollution, renewable energy, such as photovoltaics, has been vigorously developing. However, the output of photovoltaic energy has strong volatility and intermittency. Thus, the photovoltaic generation system cannot constantly meet the load demand. To address this problem, a virtual power plant with hydro-photovoltaic-thermal generation is proposed in this paper. This virtual power plant utilizes the complementary characteristics of the output of the power sources to ensure a smooth and stable total output curve, and the power supply quality of the virtual power plant is improved. Further, the nonlinear operating cost model of the virtual power plant, with output changing over time, is established on the weighted output of hydro, photovoltaic, and thermal power; then, the corresponding marginal cost model of the virtual power plant is obtained. In the electricity market, three typical mid- to long-term electricity decomposition methods based on average, tracking load and spot price are constructed, and the spot price is predicted by the auto regressive moving average model (ARIMA) model, while the relationship between the spot price and the marginal cost of the virtual power plant is obtained; the marginal cost could also be adjusted based on the ARIMA model. Based on above factors, the sizing model of the virtual power plant is established, considering investment and complementary benefits. Finally, a case study is undertaken, where the sizing scheme for the increasing local load in the typical scenarios of the planning year and the corresponding annual rate of return are obtained. Sensitivity analysis of the influence for the above factors on the sizing of the virtual power plant is carried out. The optimal ratio of mid- to long-term electricity and its decomposition methods, as well as the capacity of the virtual power plant and the sizing ratio of hydropower, photovoltaic, and thermal power are obtained. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the significance of renewable energy infeed forecast and presents two optimization methods. In contrast to usual procedures, this paper does not show an optimization of weather forecast but rather highlights optimization methods and possibilities to improve the forecast of renewable energy infeed i. e. in a control area based on multiple forecast provider time-series. Thereby, a sufficiently accurate and reliable infeed of highly volatile energy sources is essential for transmission system operators (and others) to optimize the Day-Ahead Congestion Forecast (DACF). Moreover, it is crucial for energy traders/producers like Virtual Power Plants (VPP) to increase the profits with an optimized energy placement at different markets. For this purpose, the paper presents two approaches (Least Squares Method and Energy Minimization Method) to improve the overall forecast by using provider data. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the influence of a security slope and other factors in different case studies. © 2017 IEEE.},

Based on day-ahead price forecasts, energy costs can be considerably reduced by shifting energy-intensive processes to times with lower energy prices. While the mechanism of the market match demand and supply, they currently do not consider technical limitations of the electrical power grid. A large number of consumers scheduling electrical loads according to the same price forecast could result in congestion in the transmission or distribution systems. We propose a mechanism for day-ahead scheduling that enables negotiation of load profiles between multiple consumers and an aggregator in compliance with overall power limits. We present two mechanisms for an aggregator without knowledge about internal details of the participants to achieve this goal and compare the performance to the results of a centralized scheduler with global knowledge. © VDE VERLAG GMBH Â Berlin Â Offenbach},

	abstract = {In electricity markets with a dual-pricing scheme for balancing energy, controllable production units typically participate in the balancing market as 'active' actors by offering regulating energy to the system, while renewable stochastic units are treated as 'passive' participants that create imbalances and are subject to less competitive prices. Against this background, we propose an innovative market framework whereby the participant in the balancing market is allowed to act as an active agent (i.e., a provider of regulating energy) in some trading intervals and as a passive agent (i.e., a user of regulating energy) in some others. To illustrate and evaluate the proposed market framework, we consider the case of a virtual power plant (VPP) that trades in a two-settlement electricity market composed of a day-Ahead and a dual-price balancing market. We formulate the optimal market offering problem of the VPP as a three-stage stochastic program, where uncertainty is in the day-Ahead electricity prices, balancing prices and the power output from the renewable units. Computational experiments show that the VPP expected revenues can increase substantially compared to an active-only or passive-only participation, and in the paper, we discuss how the variability of the stochastic sources affects the balancing market participation choice. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

We present detailed results relative to the computational performance of the risk-averse formulations, the decomposition methods, and risk management and sensitivities analysis as a function of the number of scenarios and risk parameters. The implementation of the two decomposition methods relies on the parallel solution of subproblems, which turns out to be paramount for computational efficiency.

Different system uncertainties due to the intermittent renewable energy sources, retail customers' demand, and electricity prices are considered in the model. The DRX market enables a VPP to purchase demand response services, which can be treated as 'virtual energy resources,' from several demand response providers to reduce the penalty cost on the deviation between the day-head bidding and the real-time dispatch. This could increase the expected profit and the renewable energy utilization of the VPP. The overall energy bidding problem is modeled as a three-stage stochastic program, which can be solved efficiently by the scenario-based optimization approach. Extensive numerical results show that the DRX market participation can improve the VPP's energy management. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

This paper investigates these impacts by developing a model of a centralized Vehicle to Grid system and applying it to the 2015 wholesale electricity market in Texas (Houston Hub) for selling energy and capacity. Three scenarios are examined. In the first scenario, electric vehicles are paid based on a fixed retail market price; in the second, they are paid a time-varying retail market price; in the third, the virtual power plant shares 50% of its total reward with the participating vehicles. The results demonstrate that, while this system is always financially profitable to the virtual power plant and the system operator gets grid services, the electric vehicles could lose money. Further, results show that these vehicles with lower per unit output-battery cost could lose more money because of extensive battery over-use and insufficient reward at current market prices. Lower battery costs, subsidies for participation in this system, and more rewarding market products could all make their participation more economically viable. © 2018},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of measurement and communication infrastructures in power grids has led to the development of new applications and use cases in the utility sector, such as demand side management and virtual power plants. The success of such applications, however, depends on a proper interplay of the underlying communication network and the power grid. For this reason, integrated planning approaches for the extension of measurement and communication infrastructures in the power grids have recently been a hot research topic. Although such planning techniques are of crucial significance for an optimum network design satisfying the requirements of both the power system and the communication network, a simulative performance analysis must accompany the planning process. Therefore, in this work we present a co-simulation environment and tool chain to enable integrated planning and subsequent performance analysis of a wide area measurement system.

	abstract = {Renewable energy resources (RES), such as photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, are environmentally friendly and can help to meet the fast growing load demand. Further, electric vehicle (EV) is a reliable alternative for the conventional vehicles given its technical and environmental advantages. However, due to the intermittent nature of the solar PV output, and also the electric and the economic issues that can be caused by the EV mass charging, a suitable paradigm is necessary for a better integration of EV charging with PV systems in distribution power systems. In this paper, a model of a virtual power plant (VPP), comprises the PV system and the EVs' parking lot, connected to a distribution power grid is developed. A consecutive energy management (CEM)-based methodology is presented to assign an organized and economic energy management for the VPP and to address the electric constraints for the power systems. Both the electric and economic impacts of the VPP and the efficacy of the CEM method are assessed through different case studies. The results from the case studies show that the proposed CEM method can decrease the cost of energy to the VPP and facilitate the integration of the VPP in power systems under varying system conditions. © 2019 IEEE.},

A suitable schedule of interactions and communications between aggregators, market operators, system operators, generators, and consumers, regarding electricity market participation and network operation is proposed and presented in a sequence diagram. The cooperation on congestion management in the distribution network is highlighted as a solution to relieve network constraints via the optimal adjustment of active and reactive power of VPP resources while maximizing renewable energy integration across the pool under management. The VPP reduces uncertainty affiliated with input data by employing the latest forecasts through a rolling horizon approach in the planning stage. Thanks to the flexibility of the VPP to perform rescheduling in accordance with agreements it negotiated with its resources, it becomes possible to refrain from undesirable curtailments. Both the market-integrative and the service-centric roles of the VPP are verified through modeling and simulation with a benchmark European distribution network. The results confirm the added value of the proposed VPP in enhancing the integration of wind and solar power. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As distributed generators (DGs) rapidly integrate into current power systems, new methods to effectively manage them need to be developed. Toward this end, a large number of geographically dispersed DGs are generally aggregated into a virtual power plant (VPP). Then, distributed control schemes are used to achieve optimal economic dispatch of the VPP by maintaining equal incremental costs of DGs while the aggregated DG power matches the dispatch command. Often, one of the drawbacks of distributed schemes is that they are susceptible to communication failures and cyber-attacks (i.e., noncolluding and colluding attacks). In order to mitigate this problem, an attack-robust distributed economic dispatch strategy is proposed where we assume that every DG can monitor the behavior of its in-neighbors and has the network connectivity information. The proposed strategy detects the misbehaving DGs residing in the network and gradually isolates them so that the remaining well-behaving DGs could still accomplish the economic dispatch. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated through simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid transition of energy markets from centralized to distributed models entails several challenges, such as the management of bi-directional energy flows and complex transactions, increased volatility, exponential growth of the number of players and of data volume, legacy issues for players, cyber security and data privacy. Direct peer-to-peer trading based on the blockchain technology applied to the virtual power plant concept can create a direct connection between suppliers and consumers of energy and represents a viable solution to meet these challenges. Blockchain can be defined as an immutable distributed ledger that verifies and records, in a safe and secure way, peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority. In recent years, blockchain is acquiring an increasing relevance, since it guarantees transparency for every transaction, creates trust through a shared database, and increases the efficiency of the transactions. Furthermore, blockchain reduces the number of third-party intermediaries, simplifies market processes and architectures, and increases operational efficiency. Blockchain technology has an extensive range of use that can disrupt the energy sector. For instance, it has the potential to speed-up an open energy market also for small customers, where electricity prices come from the balance of demand and supply like other tradable commodities. Peer-to-peer energy trading platforms also open-up the possibility to distinguish where energy is coming from (i.e., renewables, coal, oil, and gas), which allows environmentally conscious consumers to choose renewable energy. The aim of this work is to investigate how blockchain can transform the current energy market in order to highlight the advantages and disadvantages and to understand the related potentials and risks for prosumers and grid operators. Moreover, managerial insights will be provided for supporting stakeholders and regulators in the management of the future energy market enabled by the blockchain. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

Modelling is performed by applying an optimisation framework to a portfolio of household datasets with solar, simulated storage and flexible demand capabilities; a local community windfarm and large business buildings. Initial simulations show that internal energy trading between members of such a social energy network is highly dependent on local market conditions.

The 'centers of mass' of the absorbed and injected currents (loads and generation, respectively) are compensated by minimizing the distance between them, through proper redispatching of the power of the available units and interruptible loads. The technique is recursively applied to lesser parts of the distribution line to address local phenomena and is assumed to be offered as ancillary service to the system operator by a virtual power plant. The favorable results of the methodology are assessed on a distribution line of the island of Rhodes (Greece) under critical loading for numerous scenarios.

This paper introduces a VPP concept based on an optimization on top of Real Time Control approach using a market-based Multi Agent System (MAS) which controls the flexibility of electricity and heat demand and supply using a dynamic pricing as steering signal. The peculiarity of this approach is to derive the thermal constraints of the optimization from the market bids rather than from thermal models. This reduces all the thermal constraints to a single constraint, leading to a faster optimization, that scales well with the number of houses and which can be executed often to minimize the impact of forecast and model uncertainties. In this paper, a 50 households VPP simulation has been implemented and shows significant cost savings potential. © 2017 IEEE.},

The electricity price is modeled endogenously using a deterministic function depending on a joint fuels and demand process.We state conditions on the fuels/demand dynamics and the bid stack function under which the electricity forwards are martingales. The martingale property allows us to derive hedging strategies.We find that for liquid power forward contracts our model implies cointegrated forwards. As power forward contracts are not always liquid, we construct an alternative hedging strategy where fuels are used to hedge power based on the marginal fuel according to the merit order of the market. As an example, we use the structural model of Carmona, Coulon and Schwarz and test the performance of our hedging strategies in case of a virtual power plant. Based on an hourly hedging profile, we state a result on how to come from an hourly forwards hedging strategy to a hedging strategy using exchange-traded futures (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc). © 2017 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.},

	abstract = {The increasing dissemination of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) will have a significant impact on the planning and operation of the electricity grid. Many of these DERs have operational constraints e.g. weather conditions or self-sufficiency of resources or interactions within a multimodal environment. Today, established concepts on Virtual Power Plants aggregation often lack the possibility of automated, standardized and near real-time reconfiguration in case of failures or planning issues with these volatile DERs. In spite of standardization approaches a standardized description model for energy resources and their capabilities which allows aggregators to automatically find contributing or substituting DERs is lacking. The recent development in the electricity grid towards increasing Information and Communication capabilities can be used for a large scale information and allocation system for energy resources. Such a registry for energy resource capabilities will provide the opportunity for DERs to promote actual information about their capabilities based on forecasts and operational plans. Aggregators can select appropriate resources for their VPP configuration and reconfiguration while system operators can e.g. observe the grid status and the allocated capacities of all active DERs registered at the registry. In order to achieve the goals and to optimize the usage of especially renewable DERs, three main research question have to be addressed: (1) The definition of a standardized, abstracted and generalized description model for DER capabilities. (2) The interoperability and communicational requirements for such energy services. (3) Identifying the current applications and potential contributions to the development of future energy markets. © 2017 De Gruyter Oldenbourg. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Virtual power plants (VPP) play a crucial role in balancing the electricity smart grid. VPPs aggregate energy from decentralized sources, for example, biogas, solar panels, or hydropower, to generate and consume electricity on demand. We study the management of electric vehicle (EV) fleets organized in VPPs as a way to address the challenges posed by the inflexible energy supply of renewable sources. In particular, we analyze the potential of parked EVs to absorb electricity from the grid, and provide electricity back to the grid when needed. A fleet owner can either charge, discharge for renting, discharge to the grid, or keep an EV idle. A unique property of our mixed rental-trading strategy is that decisions are made between making an EV available for rental, where the location within the city matters (drivers want a car to be close to their place of departure or arrival) and for discharging it to the grid, where location does not matter (vehicles can discharge to the grid from any capable charging point). We study the feasibility of VPPs for a fleet of 1500 real EVs on the “Nord Pool Spot,” a North European electricity spot market. A Fourier series approach captures the demand patterns of carsharing vehicles accurately, especially when our weighted objective function with asymmetric payoffs is applied. We show that the VPP can be profitable to fleet owners, ecologically advantageous through reductions in wind power curtailment, and beneficial to consumers by reducing energy expenses. © 2018 The Authors.

The large-scale integration of renewable energy and energy storage systems have introduced many technical and economic challenges to both customers and utilities. High levels of renewable power injection might reduce grid stability due to intermittencies. The proposed VPP mitigates these issues and can function as a major component of a utility grid with high levels of DER penetration. The VPP has two components: a forecast and analytics component, and an electrical systems control component. The forecaster generates the dispatch schedule for each player in the VPP e.g. a PV station, and the loads. This is done by taking historical load and weather data, models of the VPP players, and the weather forecast as inputs. The electrical systems controllers use the dispatch schedule to regulate power flows from each individual player and to the loads. Grid frequency and voltage support are also provided by the control, thereby improving system stability. An example VPP with three solar photovoltaic and two battery energy storage systems is presented and implemented using a real-time digital simulator. The results validate the VPP performance in load forecasting, power flow control and grid support. A dispatch schedule is generated for a 24-hour period and the VPP controller operation to service the loads and supply the power sold on the day-ahead market was verified. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A significant increase in distributed power generation from renewable energy sources (RES) can be observed in German distribution grids. This development leads to a rising need for grid expansion. To avoid cost-intensive grid expansion measures, distribution system operators can nowadays curtail feed-in from RES in case of congestion. In future, the utilization of flexibility provided by distributed generation, demand and storage units via market-based mechanisms might be a more efficient alternative. To analyze the applicability and benefits compared to a curtailment of feed-in from RES, a contribution margin optimizing simulation approach for virtual power plant dispatch incorporating grid restrictions is suggested in this paper. With this method, calculations are performed for an exemplary distribution grid with a high penetration of RES. The results show that market-based flexibility provision can efficiently resolve congestion while leading to a higher integration of electricity from RES and a significant reduction of congestion management costs. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern power system is revolving around three major studies: Virtual power plants, power system reliability, and distributed energy resources. The three concepts are interlinked in such a manner, that one can affect the other in either positive or negative way. The involvement of wind and solar systems at distribution level aid to power system generation, but cause a major issue of changes in the conventional protection method of power system. These resources, on the other hand, aid virtual power plants, which give relaxation to the system operators for solving energy and ancillary issues with protection being one of them. In other words, these virtual power plants are both the problem creators, and problem solvers. Literature mostly discusses the reliability issues in power system with the use of virtual power plants. The paper discusses the way these virtual power plants can be utilized for improving the reliability issues due to the high involvement of distributed energy resources on the grid. The paper proposes a model of virtual power plant for the indication and isolation of faults in the power grid, and some test cases in practical scenarios. The model is finally validated using different case studies with the objective of enhancing the TSO and DSO visibility to the faults. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the future power system with high penetration of renewables, renewable energy is expected to undertake part of the responsibility for frequency regulation, just as the conventional generators. Wind power and battery storage are complementary in accuracy and durability when providing frequency regulation. Therefore, it would be profitable to combine wind power and battery storage as a physically connected entity or a virtual power plant to provide both energy and frequency regulation in the markets. This paper proposes a real-time cooperation scheme to exploit their complementary characteristics and an optimal bidding strategy for them in joint energy and regulation markets, considering battery cycle life. The proposed cooperation scheme is adopted in a real-time battery operating simulation and then incorporated into the optimal bidding model. The scheme could improve the wind regulation performance score and allow for more regulation bids without affecting the battery life, thus significantly increasing the overall revenue. The validity of the proposed scheme and strategy are proved by the case study. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The automotive industry is facing many significant challenges that go far beyond the design and manufacturing of automobile products. Connected, autonomous and electric vehicles, smart cities, urbanization and the car sharing economy all present challenges in a fast-changing environment which the automotive industry must adapt to. Cars no longer are just standalone systems, but have become constituent systems (CS) in larger System of Systems (SoS) context. This is reflected in the emergence of several acronyms such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) expressions. System of Systems are defined systems of interest whose elements (constituent systems) are managerially and operationally independent systems. This interoperating and/or integrated collection of constituent systems usually produce results unachievable by the individual systems alone, for example the use of car batteries as virtual power plants. This paper will (1) discuss automotive challenges the industry is currently facing, (2) provide an introduction into System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), (3) provide examples and case studies of successful SoSE, and (4) make recommendations on how to address the automotive challenges applying SoSE. © 2018 SAE International; General Motors LLC.},

Selected data can be aggregated up to city level, or user defined and selected levels such as district, neighbourhood, low voltage electricity network, district heating network etc. Two types of analysis can be performed by the VPP: ‘as is’ model(s), representing the structures and consumption patterns currently in place (the status quo), and ‘what if’ (variant) model(s), representing possible alternatives such as adding photovoltaics (PV) at building and/or distribution levels. Target users, city planners and utility companies, will be able to use the VPP to gain an understanding of energy demand/generation at user defined and selected levels of interest ranging from high level city planning to the selection of individual buildings or user defined energy networks and so on. ‘What if’ scenarios aid in future development and planning of cities.

Several works in literature propose the use of data centers as a virtual power plant (VPP) and their participation in the power market. A day-ahead load forecasting is an integral part of the energy management system (EMS) of data centers providing a baseline to schedule energy resources and thus reducing operating costs. Traditional methods of load forecasting are not suitable for a data center load due to its high variability and a difference in service from the utility load. Hidden Markov model (HMM) is a very flexible tool for modeling heterogeneous data, which is especially useful when the response is highly variable. Here, we propose an HMM to forecast the day-ahead load of a data center to assist in scheduling of available resources. A case study on the data center at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - Research Support Facility (RSF) resulted in an annual average mean percentage absolute errors (MAPE) of 2.93% and 3.52% for two models proposed. © 2018 IEEE.},

In addition to that it is possible to define soft and hard feed-in and acquisition constraints for the overall VPP energy schedule. To enable the VPP optimization and take into account these three different optimization levels, an accounting method which considers all internal and external usages of energy for each asset is introduced. The simulation results show that the optimization model can effectively find the economically best schedule by varying trading volumes, energy self-sufficiency of single users or exchange of energy within the VPP. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) is steadily increasing, their aggregation can offer significant storage to improve the electric system operation in many aspects. To this end, a comprehensive stochastic optimization framework is proposed in this paper for the joint operation of a fleet of EVs with a wind power producer (WPP) in a three-settlement pool-based market. An aggregator procures enough energy for the EVs based on their daily driving patterns, and schedules the stored energy to counterbalance WPP fluctuations. Different sources of uncertainty including the market prices and WPP generation are modeled through proper scenarios, and the risk is hedged by adding a risk measure to the formulation. To obtain more accurate results, the battery degradation costs are also included in the problem formulation. A detailed case study is presented based on the Iberian electricity market data as well as the technical information of three different types of EVs. The proposed approach is benchmarked against the disjoint operation of EVs and WPP. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively benefit EV owners and WPP by reducing the energy costs and increasing the profits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The energy use of these TCLs is coordinated with a novel bottom-up asynchronous, anonymous, and randomizing control paradigm called Packetized Energy Management (PEM). A macro-model for a population of TCLs is developed and then augmented with a timer to capture the duration and consumption of energy packets and with exit-ON/OFF dynamics to ensure consumer quality of service. PEM permits a virtual power plant (VPP) operator to interact with TCLs through a packet request mechanism. The VPP regulates the proportion of accepted packet requests to allow tight tracking of balancing signals. The developed macro-model compares well with (agent-based) micro-simulations of TCLs under PEM and can be represented by a controlled Markov chain. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The burden of excess energy from the high renewable energy sources (RES) share creates a significant reduction of residual load for the future, resulting in reduced market prices. The higher the share of stochastic RES, the more often the price will be 0/MWh. The power market needs new methods to solve these problems. The development of virtual power plants (VPPs) is aimed at solving techno-economic problems with an increasing share of RES in the power market. This study analyses a possible implementation of stochastic and deterministic RES in a VPP to generate secured power, which can be implemented in the European Power Exchange (EPEX)/European Energy Exchange (EEX) power market using existing market products. In this study, the optimal economic VPP configuration for an RES-based power plant is investigated and implemented into standard power market products. The results show that the optimal economic VPP configuration for different market products varies, depending on the energy availability and the marginal costs of the VPP components. The size of the VPP components is positively correlated to the components' share of the energy generated. It was also found that projecting or implementing VPPs in Germany at current market prices (EPEX/EEX prices) is not yet economically feasible for a small share of market products. However, the secured power can be marketed on the SPOT and in the futures market with higher and more stable prices compared with the status quo. © 2018 by the authors.

Though, in order to be successful, these markets will heavily depend on a management virtual power plant (MVPP) with a microgrid (MG) to facilitate a cost-efficient combination of DGRs into the current power system, thus formulating a transactive energy system. The management of the VPP and the MGs are improved to give greater controllability of the DGRs and to implement structures for the improvement of the interfaces among the energy and ancillary service resources, network operators, demand response programs (DRP) and energy market participants. Through this aggregation, DGR access to the energy markets is expedited and the DGR-based system maintenance and ancillary services can be presented. By approving this further functionality, it is envisioned that the system's production, measured in the form of energy efficiency, energy quality, security, and economical operation, can be developed. The paper concludes with case studies illustrating the utilisation of the management on an analysis system. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose to use these energy resources in demand response (DR) by operating a data center as a virtual power plant (VPP). An optimization model is designed which schedules the energy resources on a day-ahead basis using forecasted values of both renewable energy sources and the data center load for participation of the data center in DR. This optimization model also incorporates realtime dispatch of units to handle variations during operation. An improved battery cost model is designed and implemented as a soft constraint in the VPP energy management system (EMS) model, ensuring that the batteries' use in DR does not affect their float life. A case study is conducted in which the data center is connected to bus 8 of the modified IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that real-time operation of a data center participating in DR significantly reduces the operational cost, especially during network congestion, without causing battery degradation. © 2018 IEEE.},

In the case of wind and solar plants, their uncertain power generation is another issue for their participation in the market, especially when their capacity is low.

This paper proposes a new bidding strategy approach for the participation of CVPP in the day-ahead energy market, considering uncertainties of wind turbine generation and Market Clearing Price (MCP). The market is pay as bid, and each participant bids a multi-step price-power curve. The uncertainty of MCP has formulated analytically, while the wind uncertainty is modeled by a quantized Rayleigh probability distribution function. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized for optimizing the objective function, which is the expected benefit of the CVPP.

However, due to their fluctuating feed-in, renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems need to be closely monitored and controlled, which in turn results in considerable communication effort. Aiming at reducing the periodic, costly wide-area communication of monitoring data between the PVs and the VPP, we introduce and validate in this paper our approach of Model Predictive PV Control Communication (MPCC). Leveraging a dedicated Efficient PV Production (EPVP) model which synchronously estimates the PV production on both ends of the wide-area communication path, i.e. the DERs and the VPP, the amount of transmitted monitoring data can be reduced considerably (up to 100% depending on weather conditions and acceptable prediction error). The introduced EPVP model is validated with real-life data of various PV systems. Finally, the proper parametrization and efficiency of the proposed MPCC has been analysed for various weather conditions. © 2014 IEEE.},

One concept for the market integration of distributed energy resources (DER) is the virtual power plant (VPP). A VPP aggregates a portfolio of smaller DERs and operates them as a unified and flexible resource on the energy and balancing power markets. The operation planning of the market participation is, however, characterized by uncertainties, mainly due to the forecasting errors of renewable energy resources. Thus, this paper presents a model for the multi-market operation planning plan of a VPP with regard to the forecasting errors of the associated DERs. The spot- and intraday markets and the balancing power markets are modeled individually to ensure a valid market participation of the VPP. The forecasting errors are integrated in the planning process through a two-stage stochastic optimization. Exemplary results show the impact of controllable DERs in the planning process of a VPP consisting of a storage system and several PV power plants. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The core objective of the joint research project "arrivee" is the integration of widely available wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with anaerobic sludge digestion into an optimized control reserve and storage concept. Therefore the excellent technical conditions of those plants such as combined heat and power (CHP) units as well as gas storage units will be used. By means of analyzing energy consumption and production processes of existing WWTPs the potential to provide ancillary services for energy grids is investigated. Using a mathematical model of an existing WWTPs the effects of external interventions for the supply of ancillary services under different conditions are tested. Therefore, different processes will be analyzed in detail. The integration of WWTPs into a virtual power plant (VPP) is mandatory because a single plant can't provide enough capacity to participate on energy markets. The initial results present a theoretical potential of control reserve of WWTPs in Germany focusing on a CHP/gas unit of a magnitude of 300 MWel. This results show a substantial potential of WWTPs to provide ancillary services, by reshaping the existing infrastructure in a sustainable, ecological and economic way.

	abstract = {In nowadays Smart Grids, economic optimizations performed by Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) may interfere with stable grid operation required by Distribution System Operators (DSOs). Since Smart Grids and VPPs are important building blocks of future energy systems, bridging the gap between economic optimization performed by VPPs and stable grid operation required by DSOs is an important task. In this paper, we present a fundamental system architecture and a concept enabling VPPs and DSOs to negotiate their positions to satisfy the needs and requirements of both sides. Thus, instead of being a potential interference factor, economically sensible operation of distributed energy resources (DERs) organized in VPPs and stable grid operation as required by DSOs are integrated in a common solution. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Significant reductions of greenhouse gas emission by use of renewable energy sources belong to the common targets of the European Union. Smart grids address intelligent use and integration of conventional and renewable generation in combination with controllable loads and storages. Two special aspects have also to be considered for smart grids in future: rural conditions and electric vehicles. Both, the increasing share of renewable energy sources and a rising demand for charging power by electrical vehicles lead to new challenges of network stability (congestion, voltage deviation), especially in rural distribution grids. This paper describes two lighthouse projects in Europe ("Well2Wheel" and "Smart Rural Grid") dealing with these topics. The link between these projects is the implementation of the same virtual power plant technology and the approach of cellular grid cells. Starting with an approach for the average energy balance in 15 minutes intervals in several grid cells in the first project, the second project even allows the islanded operation of such cells as a microgrid. The integration of renewable energy sources into distribution grids primary takes place in rural areas. The lighthouse project "Smart Rural Grid", which is founded by the European Union, demonstrates possibilities to use the existing distribution system operator infrastructure more effectively by applying an optimised and scheduled operation of the assets and using intelligent distribution power routers, called IDPR. IDPR are active power electronic devices operating at low voltage in distribution grids aiming to reduce losses due to unbalanced loads and enabling active voltage and reactive power control. This allows a higher penetration of renewable energy sources in existing grids without investing in new lines and transformers. Integrated in a virtual power plant and combined with batteries, the IDPR also allows a temporary islanded mode of grid cells. Both projects show the potential of avoiding or postponing investments in new primary infrastructure like cables, transformers and lines by using a forward-looking operation which controls generators, loads and batteries (mobile and stationary) by using new grid assets like power routers. While primary driven by physical restrictions as voltage-band violations and energy balance, these cells also define and allow local smart markets. In consequence the distribution system operators could avoid direct control access by giving an incentive to the asset owners by local price signals according to the grid situation and forecasted congestions. © 2016 CIGRE.

To capture the intrinsically stochastic nature of renewable power generation and market prices, the problem is formulated as a stochastic program. The decisions in the balancing market include actual renewable power usage and flexible demand management. Our model ensures that a certain portion of the renewable power generation will be utilized. A Lyapunov optimization based algorithm, which does not require the knowledge of probability distributions of the related random processes, is proposed to solve the problem.

The implemented virtual power plant consists of distributed energy sources including ten solar panels providing 1 MW aggregate power, six wind turbines generating 9 MW aggregate power, and ten grid connected battery energy storage systems which support the overall grid. Importantly, the capacity, the availability and the uninterrupted operation of the virtual power plant were identified as metrics to evaluate the real-time integration of distributed energy sources into the virtual power plant. Furthermore, optimization techniques were developed using mixed integer linear programming in CPLEX (IBM ILOG optimization studio) to identify the optimal real-time operating margins for the aggregate virtual power plant. Using the optimal real-time integration control mechanism, the capacity factor of the virtual power plant was improved by 45 %, the system unavailability was reduced by 5.3 %, and the system interruption was reduced by 65.47 %, while the duration of the interruption decreased by 13 minutes per day as compared to non-optimal integration control strategies. The obtained results demonstrate that the optimal real-time integration control mechanism yields a more functional and reliable integration control of the virtual power plant, and thus increases the economic feasibility of distributed energy resources in the energy market. © 2014 IEEE.},

This paper presents the framework of such a LVPP which uses a hierarchal layer architecture. Thereby not only the heat and storage constraints in the households are considered also limitations of the low and medium voltage grid can be taken into account. With a numerical simulation of the LVPP the storage potential over the year is calculated. It is shown that the storable energy has only a marginal dependency on the temperature. The mean storage energy is about 2MWh per 1MW installed μCHP. In contrast the storage time various over a wide range within the year. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In modern power systems and electricity markets, demand response (DR) programs play an important role enabling the mitigation of critical load periods or price-peaking scenarios, thereby improving system reliability. Price fluctuations, in forward or real-time markets, can be an effective price-based DR mechanism for curtailing or shifting load. However, using dynamic pricing to achieve a desired load profile requires both an accurate demand forecast and knowledge of the price elasticity of demand, which is notoriously difficult to estimate. The limited accuracy of these parameter estimates is the main source of uncertainty limiting appropriate DR implementation. In this paper, we present a novel DR scheme that avoids the need to predict the price elasticity of demand or demand forecast, yet still delivers a significant DR. This is done based on the consumers' submissions of candidate load profiles ranked in the preference order. The load aggregator then performs the final selection of individual load profiles subject to the total system cost minimization. Additionally, the proposed DR model incorporates a fair billing mechanism that is enhanced with an ex post consumer performance tracking scheme implemented in a context of a virtual power plant aggregating load and generation units. © 2014 IEEE.},

Domestic electric heat pumps (EHP), which are expected to be widely deployed in the future, can be considered as one potential source of such system flexibility. However, this can also lead to negative impacts for building occupant comfort and to increased peak demand, through reduction in load diversity. Such impacts may be mitigated through the deployment of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), although the benefit this brings is not well understood. Therefore, this paper presents a method to quantify the impact on occupant comfort level and load diversity, through various payback metrics. A validated model is then used to simulate the extraction of reserve capacity from a cluster of 500 domestic buildings with EHPs and different configurations of space heating buffer. Performance in terms of occupant comfort and payback is evaluated. © 2016 IEEE.},

In order to provide reliable power, datacenters are provided with on-site generators and large backup resources. These resources are designed to provide power during grid failure, therefore they are underutilized most of the time. In addition, load demand of the datacenter is flexible and the datacenter's resources are designed to meet the peak load. Resource use during average load conditions is very low and they remain idle. These characteristics make datacenters ideal candidates for VPP. This paper presents a new method to operate a datacenter as a virtual power plant and participate in the power market.

Thus, the new system, the virtual power plant, is able to emulate the characteristics of today's conventional power plants. However, at present, energy storage devices are expensive and proper selection of the energy storage technology that is to be grid integrated with wind power plants is necessary. In this paper, a methodology for selection of the most suitable energy storage technology for grid integration with wind power plants is proposed. The selection process is service-oriented and thus the energy storage technology is selected based on certain requirement criteria. The primary frequency regulation service was chosen, for example, due to its potential economic benefits. For this service, low cost per cycle at partial charge/discharge was found as the requirement criterion while Li-ion batteries where found as the devices which could best fulfil this requirement. Since accurate and fast battery performance models are indispensable for studying the virtual power plant behavior under different operating conditions, impedance-based performance-degradation models were developed for the two most suitable Li-ion chemistries for the primary frequency regulation service: LiMO2/Li4Ti5O12 and LiFePO4 /C. © 2013 IEEE.},

VPPs are formed via the aggregation of a large number of DERs, so that they exhibit the characteristics of a traditional generator in terms of predictability and robustness. In this work, we promote the formation of such “cooperative” VPPs (CVPPs) using techniques from the field of distributed Artificial Intelligence and game theory. In particular, we design a payment mechanism that encourages DERs to join CVPPs with increased size and visibility to the network operator. Our method is based on strictly proper scoring rules and incentivises the provision of accurate predictions of expected electricity generation from member DERs, which aids in the planning of the supply schedule at the Grid. We empirically evaluate our approach using the real-world setting of 16 commercial wind farms in the UK, and we show that it incentivises real DERs to form CVPPs, and outperforms the current state of the art payment mechanism developed for this problem. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The concept of virtual power plant (VPP) has been proposed to facilitate the integration of distributed renewable energy. VPP behaves similar to a single entity that aggregates a collection of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as distributed generators, storage devices, flexible loads, etc., so that the aggregated power outputs can be flexibly dispatched and traded in electricity markets. This paper presents an optimal scheduling model for VPP participating in day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets. In the DA market, VPP aims to maximize the expected profit and reduce the risk in relation to uncertainties. The risk is measured by a risk factor based on the mean-variance Markowitz theory. In the RT market, VPP aims to minimize the imbalance cost and wind power curtailment by adjusting the scheduling of DERs in its portfolio. In case studies, the benefits (e.g., surplus profit and reduced wind power curtailment) of aggregated VPP operation are assessed. Moreover, we have investigated how these benefits are affected by different risk-aversion levels and uncertainty levels. According to the simulation results, the aggregated VPP scheduling approach can effectively help the integration of wind power, mitigate the impact of uncertainties, and reduce the cost of risk-aversion. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, it's widely accepted that the paradigm of closed context systems has altered. As software systems in combination with physical systems, termed Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) evolve to more and more complex structures to meet the continuously increasing complexity of requirements, they are faced with a variety of challenges. Those systems have to operate in an open context, meaning that the system boundary between the system and the environment changes over time. Furthermore, the operating system has to adapt its behavior to the observed environmental changes. Hence, there is a high need for the establishment of a seamless modeling framework which fosters the modeling of systems operating in open context. In this paper: 1) we explore how a modeling theory based on fuzzy logic allows for a formal specification of such systems 2) we embed the modeling theory to the SPES development method established within the German research project SPES by showing the compositionality of our approach 3) we illustrate on a show case how the approach can be applied exemplary for modeling the behavior of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP). © 2015 IEEE.},

We show how a flexibility representation based on surrogate models is extended and trained using soft constraints like avoiding frequent cold starts of combined heat and power plants. During the task of energy scheduling, the agents representing these machines include indicators in their choice for a new operation schedule. Using an example VPP we show that our approach enables the agents to reflect local soft constraints without sacrificing the global result quality. © 2016 Polish Information Processing Society.},

The controllers used are virtual power plants (VPPs) in the subtransmission network. During the control process, each load bus monitors its own bus voltage. If there is a voltage violation detected, then all VPPs will be activated at once to provide necessary reactive power support. The reactive power change required for each VPP is calculated through two step communications based on different purposes. The first step communication aims to calculate a single sensitivity needed for each load bus with VPP, whereas the second step communication aims to calculate the final reactive power change needed for each VPP based on the sensitivities obtained through an average consensus. Semidefinite programming is used in the second step communication to optimize the weight matrix such that the convergence speed for the average consensus is the fastest possible. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is tested through a modified IEEE 14-bus system with wind farms. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increased environmental concern, the photovoltaic (PV) generation capacity is growing in today's power systems. As the PV penetration rate increases, the intermittency and uncertainty of PV systems will cause frequency regulation issues. When rapid fluctuations take place, the system requires fast responding regulation to recover the frequency within a short period of time. Traditional power plants with slow dynamics are less capable of tracking the fast-changing regulation signal. In this context, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered as an effective regulation source to respond immediately to frequency deviations. This paper addresses the sizing issue of an aggregated BESS by a series of system level performance tests with different BESS penetration rates. The evaluation criteria are the control performance standards 1 and 2. Response effectiveness of the BESS with different levels of disturbances is also analyzed, with comparison to that of the traditional power plants. The proposed BESS aggregation controller is also validated using software simulations and a hardware testbed. © 2015 IEEE.},

Instead of only taking one of those perspectives into account, we capture a holistic view including all involved parties and introduce a Smart Grid approach that combines technical as well as economical aspects, thus bringing the different parties together.

	abstract = {Following the long-term goal of substituting conventional power generation, market oriented approaches will lead to interaction, competition but also collaboration between different units. Together with the expected huge number of actors, this in turn will lead to a need for self-organized and distributed control structures. Virtual power plants are an established idea for organizing distributed generation. A frequently arising task is solving the scheduling problem that assigns an operation schedule to each energy resource taking into account a bunch of objectives like accurate resemblance of the desired load profile, robustness of the schedule, costs, maximizing remaining flexibility for subsequent planning periods, and more. Nevertheless, also such dynamic approaches exhibit sub-problems demanding for centralized solutions for ahead of time scheduling of active power. In this paper we develop a hybrid approach combining the advantages of parallel tempering with a constraint handling technique based on a support vector decoder for systematically generating solutions; thus ensuring feasible overall solutions. We demonstrate the applicability with a set of simulation results comprising many objective scheduling for different groups of energy resources. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For the past several years, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has lead efforts to advance the development of standard functions for enterprise integration of distributed energy resources (DER). These efforts have helped bring inverter-connected distributed energy storage and generation into use as a grid resource. The EPRI efforts have defined a wide range of grid-supportive functions for inverters and will provide standard messages that allow these functions to be remotely monitored and managed. The fruit of this labour has been codified into the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 61850-90-7 for "smart" inverters. Once the smart inverter functions were codified, additional research focused on aggregating these resources into a grid asset in the enterprise context. The concept of an edge server, termed a DER Management System (DERMS), would manage communication to the devices and provide aggregated information to the other utility systems that need it. The DER asset information would be located in a distribution model repository, typically a geospatial information system (GIS), and that information would be sent to the DERMS. Once in the DERMS, the DER would be grouped according to any criteria the utility required. The messages to and from the DERMS server was developed in a way that complied with both the Common Information Model and MultiSpeakTM standards. Messages that were defined and tested included: • DER Group Creation; • DER Group Status Monitoring; • DER Group Capabilities Discovery; • Real Power Dispatch; • Reactive Power Dispatch; and • DER Forecasting. With the data requirements and messages defined, a test plan was developed to provide clarity on the expectations of how these messages are to be used. EPRI leveraged the ongoing work in the development of a semantic standard test harness and OpenDERMS tool to create an end-to-end test environment. These efforts culminated in the DER enterprise integration- testing workshop at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Boulder, CO in November of 2014. This critical workshop brought together several vendors, developers, and laboratories to review and test the proposed standard DER messages. The successful workshop provided momentum to the industry by adding understanding of how enterprise integration and aggregation of DER capabilities should be accomplished: this in itself is a very significant contribution to the body of knowledge. The workshop also identified several additional issues that need to be addressed as this research continues. Once this was completed, the use cases, findings, and suggested updates were shared with the CIM and MultiSpeak communities for consideration for inclusion in the next version of the respective standards. Finally, the semantic standard test harness was put online and kept available and up to date with new additions and new features making it easier to use. The intention is to develop this enterprise interface within the EPRI OpenDERMS tool and place the interface on an open-source site. The OpenDERMS source code would then be available for developer to utilize for their own projects. This paper describes the journey and major milestones from the initial meeting in Washington, D.C., in October of 2013, leading up to DER integration testing, including the creation of common functions for smart inverters, an open test harness, and perhaps most importantly, the OpenDERMS. © 2016 CIGRE.

	abstract = {In Germany, energy costs for small and medium-sized enterprises are increasing despite declining power prices on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) resulting from levies, surcharges, and taxes. In order to reduce energy costs in manufacturing companies, the self-supply using renewable energies is becoming a viable option for an increasing number of companies. This article therefore uses a case study approach to investigate whether the investment in renewable power plants for (partial) self-supply could be financially beneficial. Using a specifically developed simulation, scenarios have been created to show various energy supply options to satisfy the energy demand of a medium-sized manufacturing company. The scenarios range from a complete energy supply obtained from an external provider to the other extreme of a complete and therefore autarkic supply from a virtual power plant (VPP). All scenarios work with a balanced demand and supply, at 15-min intervals over a period of one year during which demand is the determining factor. The scenarios are based on real case data for energy demand, measured local weather data, and realistically calculated data for the VPP. Depending on the scenario, the proposed VPPs consist of power plants using wind, solar, and biomass as primary energies, and thermal and electric storage. The results show that compared to the full provision of energy through a local energy provider, adopting a partial self-supply of renewable energy is a very attractive option in financial terms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The imbalance costs of the VPP are considered in the bidding model. In the second stage, a model predictive control (MPC)-based dispatch model is proposed to optimise the real-time control actions. In the real-time dispatch model, the real-time information of the resources is continuously updated, and the deviations between the actual energy output and the contracted energy over the MPC control horizon are minimised.

The transmission network in the grid is becoming congested as a result of the load growth. Data centers have underutilized energy resources, such as backup generators and battery storage, which can be used for demand response (DR) to benefit both the electric power system and the data center. Therefore, in this paper, data center energy resources, including renewable energy, are aggregated and controlled using an energy management system (EMS) to operate as a virtual power plant (VPP). The data center as a VPP participates in a day-ahead DR program to relieve network congestion and improve market efficiency. A case study is conducted in which the data center is connected to bus 8 of the modified IEEE 30-bus test system to evaluate the potential economic savings by participating in the DR program, coordinated by the Independent System Operator (ISO). We show that the savings of the data center operating as a VPP and participating in the DR program far outweighs the expense due to operating its own generators. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, significant advances in renewable energy generation have made it possible to consider consumers as prosumers. However, with increase in embedded generation, storage of electrical energy in batteries, flywheels and supercapacitors has become important so as to better utilize the existing grid by helping smooth the peaks and troughs of renewable electricity generation, and also of demand. This has led to the possibility of controlling the times when stored energy from these storage units is fed back to the grid. In this paper we look at how energy resource sharing is achieved if these storage units are part of a virtual power plant. In a virtual power plant, these storage units become energy resources that need to be optimally scheduled over time so as to benefit both prosumer and the grid supplier. In this paper, a smart energy resources allocation algorithm is presented for a virtual power plants using genetic algorithms. It is also proposed that the cause of battery depreciation be accounted for in the allocation of discharge rates. The algorithm was tested under various pricing scenarios, depreciation cost, as well as constraint. The results are presented and discussed. Conclusions were drawn, and suggestion for further work was made. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Within the national funded project EnVisaGe (www.envisage-wuestenrot.de) a small Plus-Energy district mainly with single-family homes is built in Wüstenrot, Germany. A novel district heating system based on a cold-water heating grid supplies low temperature heat from a near surface geothermal system to the heat pumps with hot water storages in the connected buildings of the district. To reach the Plus-Energy level, highly energy efficient buildings close to passive house standard are built and equipped with large PV systems for onsite solar electricity generation. Some buildings are also equipped with electricity storages providing a capacity between 3 and 5 kWh each. Heat pumps with hot water storage offer the opportunity to shift electricity loads e.g. to periods with high solar radiation. Combined with the small electricity storages, this can significantly increase the PV self-consumption / self-sufficiency rate and help to reduce peak feed-in power to improve the grid compatibility [1] [2]. This complex energy management task requires innovative MPC (model based predictive control) schemes implemented in an appropriate monitoring and control system, which is developed and tested within the project. Apart from this local optimization on a single building level, decentralised heat pumps and batteries in a larger cluster can also deliver controllable electricity sinks as smart grid applications for electricity providers. To test these additional opportunities within the project, the heat pumps and batteries are connected to the virtual power plant of Vattenfall. Within the paper, the developed cloud-based data collection and management system is presented together with the MPC based system. Additionally, monitoring and simulation results are shown. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The structure of the energy supply in Germany is changing due to the "Energiewende", which leads to an increasing share of renewable energies and decentralized generation plants feeding into the energy system. At the same time, conventional but very reliably running power plants are taken from the grid. In comparison, renewable energies like wind or solar generate electricity energy unsteadily. Thus, innovative solutions for balancing power generation and consumption are required in order to guarantee a steady and safe energy provision. Cities can contribute to this challenge by taking unused flexibility in their infrastructure into account. The research project Smart Power Hamburg (SPH) investigates such possibilities in the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. A virtual power plant (VPP) is -constructed by using existing infrastructures. The flexible operation of generating plants is assured, so that the plant network can provide classic and new ancillary services for the power grid. For this purpose, the municipal energy supplier HAMBURG ENERGIE (HE), the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg) and the RWTH Aachen University (RWTH) collaborate in order to identify and develop innovative VPP solutions within the research project Smart Power Hamburg. © VDE VERLAG GMBH •Berlin • Offenbach.},

An optimal bidding strategy of the VPP in pool-based electricity markets is proposed based on the robust optimization. Compared with the previous studies which almost exclusively use the stochastic programming approach, our approach only requires a deterministic uncertainty set, rather than the hard-to-obtain probability distribution on the uncertain data. Moreover, the computational cost of our approach is much smaller than that of the stochastic programming based approach. A realistic case study is presented and the results obtained verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

These elements work in cooperation defining a dynamic bus where the generated power is subject to temporal constraints, which establish a coupling between traditional power flow problems related to consecutive time periods; further the uncertainty in wind power generation forecasts requires a continuous update of the planned power profiles, in order to guarantee a dynamic equilibrium among demand and supply. Model predictive control is used for this purpose, considering the dynamic equations of the storage and the wind turbine rotor as prediction models. A proper target function is introduced in order to find a trade-off between the need of minimizing generation costs and the excursions of the storage state of charge and the wind turbine angular speed from reference states. In the case study under consideration storage, wind turbines and a traditional synchronous generator are operated by the Transmission System Operator in the form of a Virtual Power Plant working as slack bus to cover network losses.

	abstract = {The integration of renewable energy into the existing energy supply system is a core challenge regarding the successful realization of the German "Energiewende". One concept to integrate decentralized regenerative power generators is a virtual power plant that operates many small facilities as one power plant. Essential parts of the concept are controllable loads and generators to reduce the impact of volatile energy resource - like wind power stations - on operational planning. Power-to-Heat-Systems (P2H) are one possible technology that can be used to a limited extent as a controllable load. The P2H-system as a component of virtual power plants is capable of supplying flexibility due to various possible operation strategies. This flexibility can either be used for ancillary services (primary, secondary and tertiary ancillary services), to provide schedule energy or for balancing group management. This paper presents a modeling approach for P2H systems as a component of virtual power plants with a high share of renewable energies. The operation strategies are evaluated with respect to economic and technical aspects and uncertainties in generation and load. The operation strategies of P2H systems are shown with regard to market integration of renewable energies within a virtual power plant and the provision of ancillary services. © 2014 The Authors.},

As a consequence, the increasing number of renewable energy systems and the decreasing number of conventional power plants lead to the inevitable step of taking over system responsibility for photovoltaics (PV). The research project PV-Regel addresses the system responsibility for PV by developing new concepts and by determining optimal market conditions for providing control reserve with PV systems. This challenge can be divided into two sections. On the one hand, there is the regulatory and market design perspective. Nowadays market conditions do not offer a suitable environment for the provision of control reserve with fluctuating energy sources. An economic participation is not possible because of weekly tendering processes as well as the resulting product time-slices and other market barriers in the German control reserve auction. On the other hand, it is necessary to focus on the technical aspects. First investigations show that PV systems with appropriate communication capabilities can easily be combined to virtual power plants and are very dynamic and precise in providing negative and positive control reserve even without additional energy storages. © VDE VERLAG GMBH • Berlin • Offenbach.},

The VPP can be represented as a distributed energy management system tasked to aggregate distributed generations (DGs), loads and storage facilities to operate as a unique power plants regardless of their locations. In this framework, the main decisions that need to be established by the VPP decision maker are: 1) to decide how to fulfill its related electric demand including bilateral contracts and 2) to bid in multi-level negotiation schemes to minimize (maximize) in a cooperative way the power bought (sold) from (to) other interconnected VPPs. The proposed approach is based on a team theory framework and on dynamic price mechanism, where all VPPs' agents cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal which is function of the subsystem state and of some controls which are shared with other subsystems. A distributed control strategy is proposed, and that includes problems in which each agent is able to communicate with other agents. Agents of the VPPs compute the control inputs at discrete time steps based on the information available to them. An example is presented to show the practical use of the method. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing share of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) entails a rising number of congestions and consequently the need for grid expansion measures in distribution grids. Preventive congestion management measures using flexibility options are a frequently discussed alternative for grid expansion. The flexibility options in distribution grids comprise flexible generation and load management as well as storage systems. However, preventive congestion management is not yet established in distribution grids. Traffic light concepts and flexibility markets are among the congestion management concepts in discussion. In order to determine the optimal design option for the future, a model for the quantitative assessment and simulation of different congestion management measures (CMMs) is needed. This publication presents a newly developed agent-based model for the evaluation of different congestion management concepts considering the perspectives of electricity market-oriented grid users and distribution system operators (DSOs). The market-oriented grid users can be divided into two major categories: Smart Homes (SHs) and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). Both concepts combine synergies from distributed energy technologies. Four different congestion management concepts are analyzed with the model for an exemplary test case. The analysis of the test case shows that the necessary amount of curtailment in distribution grids can be reduced, when actively using SHs as part of a preventive congestion management. Depending on the considered CMM, the reduction of curtailment in the examined distribution grid ranges from 15% to 35%. The most promising strategy, a market-based flexibility deployment, reduces the curtailment costs for the DSO by 33% compared to the curtailment needed without the use of flexibilities.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Past research demonstrated that novel IT-based business models generate tremendous returns for innovators. However, the risks associated with these innovations remain under-explored. This paper aims to address this critical gap analyzing risks and offering important insights particularly for practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted an exploratory multiple-case study research design. It draws on 22 semi-structured interviews with managers from leading energy utilities, as well as leading providers of virtual power plants technology within the German energy industry. Findings: The research reveals that main risks in new digital business models in the energy sector are associated with three forms of interdependence between innovation actors: the regulatory, the technological and the collaborative. To deal with these interdependencies, the authors propose an original multi-step risk management framework. This framework considers the outreach as a critical dimension for risk assessment and offers a new risk response matrix to draw individual and collective mitigation activities for specific types of risks. Practical implications: This paper offers a framework for the management of interdependence risks that are fundamental for business model innovations based on IT. Thus, it is applicable in companies both inside the energy sector and beyond. Originality/value: This paper analyzes an important digital business model innovation that has not yet been explored in management literature – the virtual power plant (VPP). It is based on original and current empirical work and proposes a novel risk management framework for business organizations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The model, analyzed on a 24 hours time horizon, is implemented and tested in GAMS. The obtained results show that the best benefit obtained by the virtual power plant owner is obtained when the energy production of analyzed available renewable energy sources is high, and the day-ahead market prices are elevated.

	abstract = {eBADGE is a European research project co-funded under the 7th Framework Programme and aiming at proposing an intelligent pan-European balancing mechanism also able to integrate bidding from Virtual Power Plant Systems (VPPs) by means of an integrated "smart" communication infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, the first step (described in the present paper) consists in studying optimal mechanisms of a cross-border balancing market optimizing the allocation of the cross-border transmission network capacities and suitable to incorporate bids from VPPs located on the distribution network. In parallel, opportune communication infrastructure characteristics able to allow its implementation are studied as well. Finally, a pilot simulator is developed for a region encompassing Austria, Italy and Slovenia allowing to analyze different implementation details and to appraise the economical convenience of a cross-border exchange of balancing resources as well as the ICT needs for its implementation. Methodology and approach are designed so as not to limit the scope to the region studied into the pilot, but permitting a gradual extension to wider regions of Europe. The simulator will be implemented in a "cloud" environment allowing to experiment a distributed participation in the three countries object of the study. The paper starts from an overview of aims and methodologies of the eBADGE project and then focuses on the issue of creating a cross-border balancing market. First, the regulatory background is clarified and then the modeling approach is illustrated in detail. First results, calculated on the basis of historical bids for the three investigated countries, are shown. These results give a rough idea of the economic advantage that the system could draw from a shared balancing market management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In modern distribution systems, the wide presence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (e.g. intermittent and non-programmable renewable sources, such as photovoltaic power plants and micro wind turbines), is going to cause increasing problems in the traditional management of the distribution grid. Recently, the use of Distributed Energy Storage Systems (DESSs) has been proposed to limit the impact of renewable power plants on the distribution grid. The presence of a large number of production plants distributed along the grid, which are able to interact between them, requires the Distribution System Operator (DSO) to adopt a proper monitoring system. To allow such an implementation, a communication and a computing architecture able to virtualize several renewable power plants installed in the same area is described in the present work. The proposed architecture can simplify the monitoring from the DSO, using the so-called Virtual Power Plant (VPP) approach. The proposed architecture has been deployed in the area of the Campus of the University of Brescia, Italy, for the monitoring of two photovoltaic (PV) plants and two different Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). The implemented infrastructure makes use of several technologies, such as IEEE 802.11ac and Long Term Evolution (LTE). The characterization of the communication infrastructure highlights the feasibility of the proposed approach (the latency is less than 20 ms in the worst case over IEEE 802.11ac links with a traffic load of 80 Mbit/s). To show the performance of such a solution, the data collected from a system composed by a PV field (64 kWp) and a Li-Ion storage system (25 kWh) has been reported. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Significant reductions of greenhouse emissions and the replacement of fossil fuels by a growing share of renewable energy sources belong to the common targets within the European Union. In this context, the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) will play a significant role to reach the targets. The German government, for example, has set the target that six million EVs will be applied until the year 2030. Consequently, a complete new group of network users will appear representing both, strong electrical loads and mobile storage batteries. On the one side, the simultaneous charging of EVs may cause network congestions and, consequently, the appropriate network enhancement is required. Otherwise, the limited daily usage time of EVs and their storage capabilities offer a chance to provide more flexibility in network operations and power balancing. The German research project "Well2Wheel" (funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environmental Protection and Reactor Security) integrates the EV-charging into the distribution network operations by actively influencing the charging processes using the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) concept. The need for network extensions can be reduced if an intelligent coordination of the charging processes in accordance with the real needs (urgent or later readiness for driving) of the EV owners is introduced. The project takes place at the supply area of the HSE AG in Darmstadt. Here a VPP is already in operation. The existing ICT infrastructure is used and the network access and charging of 46 EVs is integrated into the VPP activities. The VPP generates traffic light phases. A green phase signals the availability of high shares of regional generated renewable energy and enough network capacity. During these periods the stationary and mobile batteries can be charged without restrictions. In red phases energy should be saved and shifted as much as possible towards the green phases. By choosing different charging strategies - from a constant low charging current up to a rapid charging - network congestions can be avoided. Additionally, stationary batteries are used to store energy over the day and to provide the needed charging power for the EVs e.g. during periods of low renewable energy generation or within the evening peak demand reducing the network load in the same time. The project is focussed to gain experiences concerning the application of advanced information and communication technologies (ICT), facilities for EV management and regarding the user acceptance. An outlook regarding the EV management of the future is given in the conclusion. © 2014 CIGRE. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To implement the optimal dispatch of distributed energy resources (DER) in the virtual power plant (VPP), a distributed optimal dispatch method based on ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) transformation is proposed. The joint distribution of maximum available outputs of multiple wind turbines in the VPP is firstly modeled with the Gumbel-Copula function. A VPP optimal dispatch model is then formulated to achieve maximum utilization of renewable energy generation, which can take into account the constraints of electric power network and DERs. Based on the Gumbel-Copula joint distribution, the nonlinear functional relationship between the wind power cost and wind turbine output is approximated using ELM. The approximated functional relationship is then transformed into a set of equality constraints, which can be easily integrated with the optimal dispatch model. To solve the optimal dis-patch problem, a distributed primal-dual sub-gradient algorithm is proposed to determine the operational strategies of DERs via local decision making and limited communication between neighbors. Finally, case studies based on the 15-node and the 118-node virtual power plant prove that the proposed method is effective and can achieve identical performance as the centralized dispatch approach.},

	abstract = {In order to operate power management systems (PMSs) in a stable and efficient way, a crucial task is to stipulate the future output of dispatchable power plants in the form of schedules. Solving the scheduling problem is NP-hard in the number of power plants schedules are created for. Future decentralized PMSs, which will be characterized by a vast amount of small dispatchable generators and devices, thus necessitate scalable mechanisms based on the principles of autonomy and self-organization. While such systems can adapt to changing conditions, they also must be able to cope with uncertainties originating from an increasing number of weather-dependent power plants and new consumer types such as electric vehicles. In this paper, we take on this challenge and formalize the scheduling problem on the basis of so-called trust based scenarios in the context of a self-organizing PMS featuring a hierarchical system structure. Our model allows the agents to cope with uncertainties by creating schedules for different developments of the future output and consumption. Based on these insights, we compare two different approaches to create robust power plant schedules. These mainly differ in the way in which system level uncertainties are identified and dealt with. As our evaluation shows, our approach enables the agents to come to a compromise between risk, economic efficiency, and scheduling times. © VDE VERLAG GMBH - Berlin - Offenbach, Germany.},

	abstract = {There is a competitive relationship between Domestic Solar Water Heater (DSWH) and Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) system in terms of roof area owned by households. Hence the implementations of solar Virtual Power Plant (VPP) in urban China should be carefully assessed from cost-benefit aspects, considering the existence of widely used DSWH systems. This study comprehensively collected the information related to the cost and benefit of DSWH and BIPV systems from literatures and conducted surveys on available roof area of households in Xi'an city with 96 samples. Then 25year lifetime cost-benefit analyses were performed to demonstrate the comparison between the two solar utilization systems with different roof area. The results indicated that only when the available roof area is more than 6m2, BIPV system can utilize more solar energy than DSWH could. One typical set of DSWH requiring 3-4m2 roof area is the optimal setting, and 84% urban China households are capable to install it. BIPV system has an equivalent cost-benefit performance only if the system cost is as low as RMB 0.6/kWh, and with the presence of RMB 1.00/kWh incentive feed-in tariff. If the system cost of BIPV is RMB 0.9/kWh, available roof area of 14m2 is required but only 18% households can afford it. These results are expected to raise a potential decision making issue between DSWH and BIPV, and provide basis of guideline for implementation of projects of both systems in urban area, particularly in China. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Distributed generators (DGs) have been developing rapidly in power systems. Motivated by their intrinsic distributed nature, distributed cooperative control based upon local communication recently emerge as a preferred strategy. For instance, a cooperative power control strategy can regulate the active power from a cluster of DGs at a certain ratio of its maximal available power according to a dispatch command. However, such a networked control system is susceptible to both communication failure and cyber-attack, e.g., denial-of-service attack and deceptive attack. To address this potential problem, an attack-resilient cooperative control strategy is proposed in this paper. With a properly designed observation network, each DG can monitor the behaviors of all its in-neighbors, and gradually isolate the misbehaving DGs (when present) from the network as long as they do not collude with each other. Consequently, even certain DGs misbehave, the rest of them can together accomplish the control objective provided that the remaining communication network is still connected. Simulations of the IEEE standard 34-bus test feeder demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

Our findings indicate that the energy-related Internet subsystems are up to 2 times more robust to network failures than the national average. Further, Internet connectivity of consumers households achieves availability of > 99 % and is therefore suitable for most Smart Grid applications. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of fluctuating generation plants like wind turbines and solar power systems makes new demands on the existing power grid. Aiming at the expand of renewable energies in our electrical power supply system and their implementation as a basic grid component will lead to an increasing demand of operating reserve and balancing energy due to the stochastic feed in character. At the same time also a strong increase of efficient CHP systems in the current supply structure will be aspired. Regarding this context decentralized plants like combined heat and power (CHP) can be used in our present power supply system in such a way, that a future electricity supply with high fraction of fluctuating renewable energies as wind power and photovoltaics could be possible. In connection with enlarged thermal storages, their specific application can add a substantial contribution in combination with an aimed electricity supply of 80 % renewable energy. According to the heat demand also this form of generation indicates a stochastic feed in or consumption behavior. The integration of thermal energy storages can decouple the production of electricity and heat from time to time. Seeing that on one side the fraction of CHP systems can be developed clearly and on the other side this kind of plant configuration makes a contribution to a functioning future power supply. The paper will describe the integration of such cogeneration systems on basis of the German supply system. To combine heat and power operated solutions the operation schedule of the system and his participants is calculated by a linear optimization tool. Based on a high fraction of those combined systems, a functioning future power supply is possible basically also without intense use of battery storages. © 2016 The Authors.

The joint operation of energy and reserve market is modeled as a bilevel equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) with an upper-level objective that maximizes all μ VPPs' profit and a lower level objective that maximizes social welfare of the market clearing process. A coevolutionary approach is successfully employed to determine the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the EPEC model. The case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the coevolutionary method and show that μ VPPs' bidding/offering strategies depend significantly on the penetration level of distributed energy resources and renewable energy sources and they can be considerably influenced by rivals' strategies. This paper then compares μ VPPs' performances under different market structures and addresses the advantages of the proposed ADSM in terms of higher asset utilization rate, higher economic profit, and more secured return on investment. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the course of increasing numbers of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems coordinated operation of these units becomes a promising option. In particular a concept currently in development is the charging of EVs at arbitrary locations with own produced renewable energy e.g. from a home PV system. However this requires extensive communication to the EV due to the fluctuating power feed-in of the PV system. In order to reduce the amount of transmissions per distributed energy resources (DERs) model-predictive communication can be applied. This approach has already been proved valid for PV systems in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) where the power production data has to be transmitted continuously to central entities which balance the fluctuating feed-in from PV, wind-power and other systems. In this paper we show that the existing PV model can be enhanced with sensitivity to clouds and other shadowing effects. The proposed changes can be easily transferred to other DERs and further reduce the amount of communication - in case of a PV system especially under cloudy weather conditions. For the validation of the model publicly available real-life data from a PV system over a period of one year has been used. The proposed model-predictive communication scheme saves up to 68.6% of traffic while only inducing a mean normalized error rate of 1.09 %. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {After the liberalization of energy markets in Europe the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) concept has been introduced to enable smaller Distributed Energy Resources (DER) to participate in larger markets. Although markets and processes between VPP-aggregators and smart grid actors, such as system operators and balance responsible parties, have been improved over the last years, a gap between DERs and aggregators still exits. Classical approaches assume aggregators with a fixed portfolio of DERs. But the increasing dynamics of the system, partially based on environmental dependent DERs (wind turbines, solar power), requires a common smart market for actively offering actual DER capabilities for adaptive aggregators. In this paper, we propose such a common active registry system which can be used by DERs to provide their capabilities actively and which helps aggregators to find DERs for short- and long-term business relationships. This would enable aggregators to dynamically adjust their VPPs to serve the needs of the smart grid actors and to reconfigure the VPP in case of failures. A prototype of the registry will be built in the EU-FP7 project Open System for Energy Services (OS4ES). © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

This paper reviews the VPP in terms of components and operation systems. VPP fundamentally is composed of a number of DGs including conventional dispatchable power plants and intermittent generating units along with possible flexible loads and storage units. In this paper, these components are described in an all-inclusive manner, and some of the most important ones are pointed out. In addition, the most important anticipated outcomes of the two types of VPP, Commercial VPP (CVPP) and Technical VPP (TVPP), are presented in detail. Furthermore, the important literature associated with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) based VPP, VPP components and modeling, VPP with Demand Response (DR), VPP bidding strategy, and participation of VPP in electricity markets are briefly classified and discussed in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.},

Specifically, flexible assets, such as storage, Thermostatically Controlled Loads, smart appliances, flexible load and other flexible customer resources are expected to provide practical solutions for mitigating the variability. In this paper, a state-transition model of aggregate flexibility of a distribution feeder with responsive loads and flexible generation is derived. The method is general enough to handle any feeder with flexible resources. It yields a concise and tractable 'aggregate virtual plant' model of feeder flexibility.

A feasibility study was conducted under three scenarios in order to estimate the value of Advanced Lead-Acid (ALA) and Lithium-Ion (LI) batteries for domestic households in the UK. A profit optimization model was built using historical market data, and technical parameters of the batteries. An aggregated system of 5000 batteries was simulated and used to compare and stack value streams of seven different grid-scale services in the UK, including energy arbitrage, reserve and frequency regulation services. The results showed that using a battery system for domestic services is currently not economically viable, however grid-scale provision of dynamic frequency response and fast reserve services yield sufficient annual revenue to compensate for these losses. The annual profit margin per household obtained was £ 532/692 for ALA and LI batteries respectively, allowing a shared margin of £ 230–300 after accounting for household costs. The promotion of an aggregated storage system is hindered by current regulatory barriers in the UK, such as a double payment structure for storage operators, lack of subsidy and lack of separate definition for storage devices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Standard solutions require fixed parametrised optimisation models that the participants have to stick to without leaving room for tailored behaviour or individual preferences. We present a modelling methodology that allows organisations to specify optimisation goals independently of concrete participants and participants to craft more detailed models and state individual preferences. While considerable efforts have been spent on devising efficient control algorithms and detailed physical models in power management systems, practical aspects of unifying several heterogeneous models for optimisation have been widely ignored-a gap we aim to close. As a by-product, we give a formulation of warm and cold start-up times for power plants that improves existing power plant models. The concepts are detailed with the load-distribution problem faced in virtual power plants and evaluated on several random instances where we observe that a significant number of soft constraints of individual actors can be satisfied if considered. © 2014 Polish Information Processing Society.},

	abstract = {A virtual power plant (VPP) can realize the aggregation of distributed generation in a certain region, and represent distributed generation to participate in the power market of the main grid. With the expansion of VPPs and ever-growing heat demand of consumers, managing the effect of fluctuations in the amount of available renewable resources on the operation of VPPs and maintaining an economical supply of electric power and heat energy to users have been important issues. This paper proposes the allocation of an electric boiler to realize wind power directly converted for supplying heat, which can not only overcome the limitation of heat output from a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, but also reduce carbon emissions from a VPP. After the electric boiler is considered in the VPP operation model of the combined heat and power system, a multi-objective model is built, which includes the costs of carbon emissions, total operation of the VPP and the electricity traded between the VPP and the main grid. The model is solved by the CPLEX package using the fuzzy membership function in Matlab, and a case study is presented. The power output of each unit in the case study is analyzed under four scenarios. The results show that after carbon emission is taken into account, the output of low carbon units is significantly increased, and the allocation of an electric boiler can facilitate the maximum absorption of renewable energy, which also reduces carbon emissions from the VPP. © 2016, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A fuel cell car has all the necessary devices on board to convert the chemical energy of hydrogen into electricity. This paper considers a scenario where a parking lot for fuel cell cars acts as a virtual power plant. In order to describe the system behavior from the energy point of view, a hybrid (mixed logical dynamical) model is constructed. With this model, a control system is designed to determine the production profile for both the fuel cell and battery of each car in the parking lot subject to minimizing the operational cost. In order to deal with both the uncertainty in the demand profile and the power balance constraint, a robust min-max model predictive control algorithm is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated in a numerical example. © 2016 EUCA.},

	abstract = {The current attention to energy management leads to the necessity to tack new challenges for a best integration of renewable energies, mobility systems and new technologies for the energy efficiency, creating several micro grids with an active interaction with the main energy distribution networks. The integration of more energy systems seems to be the key of the future development and at present it is mainly applied to industrial systems, where Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are very promising instruments for promoting an effective integration. Since the built environment is one of the biggest consumers of primary energy worldwide and considering the complexity of some residential and tertiary users, the paper proposes the application of the basic principles of the VPP to the building environment introducing new functions typical of the urban context. The paper shows how an optimization algorithms, traditionally used in the industrial sector to schedule and operate a cluster of energy resources, can be successfully adapted also to residential and tertiary frameworks, proposing the aggregation of several energy sub-systems (SS), generally operated as independent, in a single one named Sustainable Energy Microsystem (SEM). © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission, future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources (RES). The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand-supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The aggregation of controllable distributed energy resources (DER) to virtual power plants (VPPs) forms a possible integration path for DER in future energy systems. The authors present a fully distributed scheduling heuristic for VPPs. The approach is realised by representing each participant of a VPP by a self-interested agent. Both the global, operator-driven scheduling objective of a VPP as well as arbitrary individual local objectives of the agents are integrated efficiently in a fully distributed coordination paradigm. Convergence and termination of the heuristic are proven in the presence of unreliable environments, e.g., with communication delays. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},
